[3/29/23, 9:13:03 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Living expenses in indiana are considered low and would not be of a great problem. But if it was the tuition fee then appx 50% burden would be reduced since it is the major portion..
[3/29/23, 9:15:26 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: You can even see in i20 that the campus housing estimate itself is around 12.5 k which indicates that it is a lot cheaper if we can find outside and share the room. That's what my concern is..
[3/29/23, 9:16:34 AM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: It should be half of 12.5

The meet up can be used as a discussion for further traveling to Indiana for the people travelling from Mumbai Airport and also to get to know each other.

[3/30/23, 4:55:40 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: Same can be done on the discord. The motive of creating a discord channel was/is to get everything in one place and in an organised manner.

[3/31/23, 2:36:22 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: If you remember where you were born or where your parents got you those vaccinations then you can go ask that clinic or hospital for your records, I believe all hospitals keep such records and you can get them anytime by showing some proof of identity
[3/31/23, 2:37:28 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: This seems to be a good idea. Thank you. Will try

I would like to know more about the i20 financial guarantee document. My bank provides bank balance certificates only in Indian rupees. Can I convert them (the total funds I have in various banks/sources) to USD using Oanda and attach the printout along with the bank balance certificates? 
I have funds in 5 different banks/sources. I am providing 5 bank balance statements (including my personal account). Can I add up the bank balances from 5 banks/sources and convert them to USD using Oanda or should I provide separate Oanda sheets for each of the 5 sources?

Guys, we have created this discord server to build the community and help each other. The recently asked questions in the group were already addressed in the common-question channel.

[4/5/23, 1:26:13 AM] ‪+91 99964 69559‬: Ahh so i have a stupid question....
What does co-borrower and co-applicant mean? Is it that both students and parents are taking loans?

And how is it beneficial as compared to only parents taking loans?🙈
[4/5/23, 1:26:15 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: Mention it under family member
I have done the same
[4/5/23, 1:27:12 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: Yeah with the help of your parents if you get loan and the loan sanction letter contains their name then they are co-borrower

[4/5/23, 1:53:35 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: No if you have co-applicant mention it under family member.

[4/5/23, 7:11:27 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: It's not.. but we can increase later also right? Now if we take 60, we need to pay processing fee of 1 percentage that will be around 70k including gst
[4/5/23, 7:11:28 AM] ‪+91 89793 00287‬: Anyone tried with idfc first bank?

[4/5/23, 7:13:17 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Yeah same like HDFC
[4/5/23, 7:15:33 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Iub will cost around 43lakhs if we get part-time that pays 10 dollars/hr and if we work 80hr/month for 10$/hr cost
[4/5/23, 7:15:48 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: For 20 mnths
[4/5/23, 7:16:37 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Is it not 12% ?
[4/5/23, 7:16:48 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Rent around 600
[4/5/23, 7:16:57 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: I got at 11.25 non collateral
[4/5/23, 7:17:22 AM] ‪+91 90155 55370‬: I got 10.8 non collateral
[4/5/23, 7:17:31 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Have people posting on FB groups with places having rents as low as 215 bucks, but just for females dammit 🥲
[4/5/23, 7:17:57 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: So how many lakhs does it cost for the total MSCS course? Including tuition fee, cost of living, etc
[4/5/23, 7:18:05 AM] ‪+91 73374 74606‬: Try negotiating I guess it goes down i got @11.5
[4/5/23, 7:18:43 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Did all negotiations and they said their standard rates are 12.5, hence reduced to 12%
[4/5/23, 7:19:21 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Which bank ?
[4/5/23, 7:19:44 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: Can any tell this?
[4/5/23, 7:19:46 AM] ‪+91 93215 07575‬: Union Bank/Canara Bank/SBI - they offer 7.5L without collateral. Beyond 7.5L, collateral is must. This is what they told me.

HDFC Bank - I don't think there is any cap loan amount without collateral. Interest is 11-13%. 1% processing fee.

IDFC First - same like HDFC. But they have many other charges like Higher Insurance, Stamp duty, notary charges, etc. Moreover, they have a system of compounding interest.

Interest rates can always be negotiable based on profile. So this may vary from person to person.
[4/5/23, 7:20:47 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: It will be approx 55 - 60(max bro)
[4/5/23, 7:21:01 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: Thanks
[4/5/23, 7:21:02 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: You can do it for less than 55 also if you manage well
[4/5/23, 7:21:25 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: 41-43L tuition and 15-20L (max) living and miscellaneous expenses I suppose
[4/5/23, 7:22:40 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: Oh got it
If u get any TA/RA/part time
It will be much more manageable i guess.
[4/5/23, 7:22:44 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: Got it
[4/5/23, 7:24:24 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: Yah
[4/5/23, 7:27:16 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: ICICI - 10.8
Axis - around 1.5
[4/5/23, 7:27:45 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: It's awesome 🫡
[4/5/23, 7:28:53 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Union Bank says 9.8 non collateral but only 40L, that won't be enough right ?
[4/5/23, 7:29:50 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: U guys r taking full loan or something from savings also
[4/5/23, 7:30:05 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: It's around 12$/ hr
[4/5/23, 7:30:48 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: How many hrs in a day can we work ?
[4/5/23, 7:31:23 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: Per week 20
[4/5/23, 7:31:30 AM] ‪+91 90593 97854‬: Did anyone get their financial documents approved by showing some amount in loan & some amount in savings?
[4/5/23, 7:31:45 AM] ‪+91 98331 60952‬: Does everyone get an opportunity to work part time?
[4/5/23, 7:32:10 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: I talked to a senior and plenty of opportunities are available
[4/5/23, 7:32:12 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Yeah just worst case
[4/5/23, 7:32:12 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: Do we get taxed on our earning?
[4/5/23, 7:32:29 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: Yes. TA/RA pay 15/hr
[4/5/23, 7:32:30 AM] ‪+91 97695 06008‬: Does iub have co op program
[4/5/23, 7:32:57 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: And intern 20 as far as I've heard
[4/5/23, 7:33:01 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: Nope
[4/5/23, 7:33:13 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: Idts not sure
[4/5/23, 7:33:44 AM] ‪+91 97695 06008‬: Like there are no coop options like u can only work within Indianapolis or so?
[4/5/23, 7:34:08 AM] ‪+1 (812) 225‑4271‬: Yes initially , you will have to file for refund
[4/5/23, 7:51:24 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: You can try icici too. I got it in 10.85
[4/5/23, 7:52:20 AM] ‪+91 85304 81881‬: Did you applied online?
[4/5/23, 7:52:50 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Yes
[4/5/23, 7:53:12 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Yeah but they are providing 40L only right?
[4/5/23, 7:53:41 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: That was the hesitation if 40L amount would suffice for our course
[4/5/23, 7:55:30 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Oh i took 30 only
[4/5/23, 7:57:08 AM] ‪+91 85001 75057‬: If we have savings of atleast 5-10 then i think we can manage by getting part time.
[4/5/23, 7:57:23 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Certainly
[4/5/23, 7:58:07 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Yeah okay.
[4/5/23, 8:21:05 AM] ‪+91 77022 73857‬: How are planning to get accommodation? Where to get started ?
[4/5/23, 8:21:38 AM] ‪+91 74061 39928‬: I was having the same question
[4/5/23, 8:24:09 AM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: Google Facebook seniors
[4/5/23, 8:24:44 AM] ‪+91 74061 39928‬: oh!

[4/5/23, 8:25:01 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Bit*
[4/5/23, 8:32:42 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Union Bank have scheme for Premier Institutes
[4/5/23, 8:33:54 AM] ‪+91 85001 75057‬: https://www.unionbankofindia.co.in/english/special-education-loan-abroadstudies.aspx
[4/5/23, 8:36:31 AM] ‪+91 76394 16875‬: Do we have to apply through vidhyalakshmu portal?
[4/5/23, 8:38:50 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[4/5/23, 8:39:01 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And fill a set of physical application too
[4/5/23, 8:39:21 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But first check with Bank whether they are giving without I20 or not
[4/5/23, 8:39:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Many reported they are not giving without i20
[4/5/23, 8:43:42 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: Guys any idea on whom to mail if we want to cancel i20.

I applied long ago, but i got other univ and now i want to cancel it as i don't want to get too many i20
[4/5/23, 8:44:35 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Contact OIS, but just wanna say, bwoahhh!
[4/5/23, 8:49:18 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: You don’t need to cancel it, you can get multiple i20s.
[4/5/23, 8:49:47 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Just use the final one while booking for visa
[4/5/23, 8:50:12 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: Applied for 3, may or may not get 4th univ

So in case the visa officer asks why 4 i20
[4/5/23, 8:50:26 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: They don’t get to know
[4/5/23, 8:50:33 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: Visa officer doesn't know how many univ we applied

But they will know how many i20 we have
[4/5/23, 8:50:42 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: People take i20 from all their admitted unis
[4/5/23, 8:51:13 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: They don't know about admits but they will definitely know about your I20s so better to have small number, possibly 2-3
[4/5/23, 8:51:30 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: Yaa, that's why want to cancel
[4/5/23, 8:51:45 AM] ‪+91 90593 97854‬: Anyone???
[4/5/23, 8:52:21 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: They probably know about it only when we apply for visa through that i20 and then apply for visa again for another uni
[4/5/23, 8:52:41 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Correct me if I’m wrong
[4/5/23, 8:53:00 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: That’s what my counsellor told as well
[4/5/23, 8:53:05 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: Not sure, but more i20 are not preferable
[4/5/23, 8:53:46 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: That's true but they can also find out if a student has been issued an I20 from any university or not since issuing an I20 registers your records in that uni's database
[4/5/23, 8:54:37 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: But they don’t know the universities we applied to🤷
[4/5/23, 8:55:07 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: How will they check for our data in that particular uni’s database?
[4/5/23, 8:55:10 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: But they know your name, DOB and other personal details
[4/5/23, 8:55:33 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: Ofc they do
[4/5/23, 8:55:38 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: I might be wrong
[4/5/23, 8:55:53 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: When issued an I20, that Sevis number gets registered in a national database with your info
[4/5/23, 8:55:54 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: But that’s what I’ve come to know from every other person I talk to
[4/5/23, 8:56:19 AM] ‪+91 74043 24414‬: They say take as much i20s as you want and then book the visa slot through one at the end
[4/5/23, 8:56:21 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Incase you want to transfer unis, DSOs from both unis access your details from that national database and make the changes
[4/5/23, 8:57:05 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: The common funda is take an I20 from whichever uni issues it to you at the earliest and then wait for your priority ones as far as I know
[4/5/23, 8:57:11 AM] ‪+91 86000 17220‬: But what's wrong with having multiple i20s? Isn't that how a candidate will proceed as and when they get new decisions?
[4/5/23, 8:58:31 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: It shows that you weren't sure of your decision for a particular uni and applied to many more and also make them question your decision to study at that particular uni
[4/5/23, 8:58:57 AM] ‪+91 70326 84188‬: 💯
[4/5/23, 8:59:06 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: But guys it's just what I've heard from many counselors and seniors so better to decide what you wanna do and go with it
[4/5/23, 9:00:04 AM] ‪+91 86000 17220‬: But you don't get all the admits at once. So naturally one will get the i20 for the admit he has and wait for further decisions
[4/5/23, 9:01:11 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: So getting 2 i20 will cause trouble?
[4/5/23, 9:01:40 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: That's what I said earlier, get an I20 issued from whichever uni gives you an admit first, book your slot using that and then wait for others...
By making all unis issue you I20s can also hinder other students who do want to go at that uni miss out incase they were wait listed or something
[4/5/23, 9:02:19 AM] ‪+91 90593 97854‬: Nipe
[4/5/23, 9:02:31 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Nah no worries, 3 is good as well but anything above that, you'll have to really make a strong point as to why you opted for this particular uni only
[4/5/23, 9:03:04 AM] ‪+91 86000 17220‬: Yea that's true but I think 2-3 is fine
[4/5/23, 9:03:21 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: ICICI is private so we need to pay simple intrest
[4/5/23, 9:03:38 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: That's what I said earlier bro...
[4/5/23, 9:06:13 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: I submitted the financial dovcs but it's showing error insufficent funds
[4/5/23, 9:06:15 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: Even though it's not
[4/5/23, 9:06:24 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: Any idea why
‎[4/5/23, 9:10:24 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: ‎image omitted
[4/5/23, 9:11:45 AM] ‪+91 99624 49511‬: Did you enter the correct amount in that blank space provided in portal?
[4/5/23, 9:12:41 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: I can't see it
[4/5/23, 9:12:43 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: Where
[4/5/23, 9:15:01 AM] ‪+91 93902 78201‬: How much amount did you show in the declaration of Financial Support
[4/5/23, 9:15:20 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: There's a separate block where you are asked how much funds will you have for your first year, how much did you enter in that?
[4/5/23, 9:16:05 AM] ‪+91 93902 78201‬: Exactly you have to re-enter the amount over there also
[4/5/23, 9:17:58 AM] ‪+91 91 3114 087 9‬: Ho guys, when will u all book flight tickets? After visa or before
[4/5/23, 9:20:50 AM] ‪+91 91 98398 850‬: Those who submitted financial docs, how long did it take for them to get approved?
[4/5/23, 9:21:13 AM] ‪+91 85001 75057‬: I dont think it is compulsory to pay simple interest during the Moratorium period, but it is better to pay because, after the moratorium period, the whole simple interest calculated until the end will be added to ur principal amount and interest will be charged thereafter on Principal+SI for 2 yrs.

also consider that SI will vary from semester to semester because SI will be calculated on the amount disbursed not on the sanctioned amount. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
[4/5/23, 9:23:34 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: For private we need to pay SI, for nbfc partial interest can be paid and for govt banks, no SI.
anyways IDFC and ICICI can give partial interest option according to university.
[4/5/23, 9:24:51 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Yeah you are right about SI accumulation

[4/7/23, 4:30:16 AM] ‪+91 96037 58691‬: Depends on the disbursement. Govt. banks send your money directly to the university. Private banks and NBFCs may disburse the amount to your account. Anyway, disbursed amount comes under liquid cash

[4/7/23, 9:31:38 AM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: I missed to add date on my financial doc, IUB asked me to resend with date in it. I did it today. Whom should I revert back to confirm them that I uploaded or is it not required? When will they check?
[4/7/23, 9:32:19 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Once your financial docs are approved, I do believe you will receive an email.  Since this does not come from our department, I am estimating on the timing. ~Amy
[4/7/23, 9:41:05 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi Ravi!  I honestly do not know that answer.  OIS handles the financial docs.  I would suggest contacting them directly.  Their number is 812-855-9086.  Normal business hours Monday-Friday:  8:30 a.m.–12 p.m. and 1 p.m.–4:30 p.m.  ~Amy
[4/7/23, 9:42:22 AM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: Handwritten should be fine
[4/7/23, 9:43:14 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If you uploaded it to your Atlas account, it will have been received, or you get an error.  OIS only reaches out to you if they need something (like your date) or they are letting your know your I20 is ready.  ~Amy
[4/7/23, 9:43:54 AM] ‪+1 (269) 697‑3195‬: Where should I send my financial docs? I didn't receive anything saying about that.

[4/7/23, 9:47:09 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: Hey @18123409769, It's been a long time since I submitted my financial documents (In Feb). I understand that you are not aware of the status, and also, there's a delay because of the shifting and OIS managing several universities at the same time.

But, It's a request; if you could ask the OIS regarding when the Luddy students can expect the I-20? Most of the students have not yet received an update on their status, and it's very unprofessional to email about everything and practically difficult for OIS to read and reply to every query.
[4/7/23, 9:47:24 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi Fabio.  Shortly after you submitted your application, you should have received information from the Office of International Services (newtoiu@iu.edu) about signing into Atlas. They would have sent sign in credentials for you to set up your account. ~Amy
[4/7/23, 9:47:54 AM] ‪+91 99964 69559‬: Ohh no worries... Thanks for sharing the contact:)

[4/7/23, 9:52:20 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Hi Amy, need a clarification. I understood that I can register for classes with an activated IUB account after the orientation and advising sessions. And also I can setup my acc once my docs are approved. So once they are all approved and I set up my IUB account, will I be able to register for the classes without yet receiving i20 ?
[4/7/23, 10:02:56 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Yes, you may register for classes without having your I20.  ~Amy
[4/7/23, 10:05:13 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Hi @18123409769 , i20s will we released like just how we receive the admits for group of students on different dates?
[4/7/23, 10:06:24 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Hi @18123409769 yesterday I have uploaded my financial documents while submitting that I got Invalid session error but when I logged in again and checked Financial documents it is showing as submitted and even I received an automated email response from OIS that it is submitted successfully. Do I need to upload them again or it is good to go?

I know our department has all our documentation uploaded to Atlas. I20s will be sent out as they are done, not as a full batch.  Hopefully that makes sense. ~Amy

Had a question for a friend. 
If he/she is uploading only a loan sanction letter for i20. 

Where should it be put in atlas under financial documentation?  

Is it in parents funding or personal funding or other funding?
[4/9/23, 11:37:29 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: I have shown in Other source of funding
[4/9/23, 11:38:07 PM] ‪+91 99728 18619‬: Few ppl were telling we need to put it along with bank statement making a pdf..
So had this confusion.
[4/9/23, 11:38:57 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: I dont find it suitable since its not our family funds its given purely for education by some third party lender
[4/9/23, 11:39:13 PM] ‪+91 99728 18619‬: I see.
[4/9/23, 11:47:17 PM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: For financial documents do we need to provide bank statements of 12 months? or 6 months is enough??
[4/9/23, 11:50:12 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: As such they haven't mentioned ig you can give 6 months
[4/9/23, 11:52:44 PM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: okay,
but what should be done..
[4/9/23, 11:53:39 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Bank statements must be in English. Each bank statement submitted must include the following details:

The name of your financial supporter. The translated name must be on the original document (not handwritten in).
The date. Documents must be dated no more than one year (12 months) prior to the date classes begin for the desired term of enrollment.
The amount of available funds and the type of currency.
The name of the bank. The name of the bank must be officially indicated on the bank statement.
[4/9/23, 11:54:11 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Since they have mentioned it should not be old than 1 year from class start date so better take for 6 months
[4/9/23, 11:56:00 PM] ‪+91 80733 07973‬: It's not a bank statement
It's a balance certificate
It should not be dated older than a year

[4/10/23, 5:57:03 AM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: Univ attested and sealed would work I think…but if it’s a one time doc you can give when you reach univ
[4/10/23, 5:58:42 AM] ‪+971 50 114 6456‬: Yeah mine is a one time document

[4/10/23, 6:10:30 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you are planning to courier them it should reach them before 1st July
[4/10/23, 6:10:35 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Or you can carry them with you to University
[4/10/23, 6:16:46 AM] ‪+91 94601 22007‬: in this form, is the signature supposed to be a digital signature, or you just have to type the name as signature?
[4/10/23, 6:21:47 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I took printout and filled it manually
[4/10/23, 6:22:19 AM] ‪+91 94601 22007‬: and then submitted the scanned document?
[4/10/23, 6:22:57 AM] ‪+91 91 82884 703‬: Physical Signature would be enough

Can you please let me know when can we create an iu account.
[4/10/23, 1:09:53 PM] ‪+91 88794 79020‬: For international students, wait until you received notification that your I-20/DS2019 is ready to download and print as your IU email account permission will not occur until this point in the student visa process. You will need to have the IU email account established in order to register for classes.

Approval of financial documents 2-4 weeks
Receiving the i20 - 6-8 weeks

Are these simultaneous or do these timelines add up? Because visa applications have a 60-90 days wait time too.

 Can I upload the financial documents twice? Like i haven’t received my loan sanction letter yet so I thought of uploading the existing bank certificates of mine and my parents.?

And once I receive the sanction letter will have the chance to upload again for the pending documents?

[4/10/23, 3:07:15 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hello Trinay.  OIS will work from when you received your admit letter.  They do not work on documents until they know a student will be offered an admission to a school.  So in your case, OIS has had all of your documentation for about 3-4 weeks. Hopefully that makes sense.  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 3:09:13 PM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Thanks Amy. Got it.
[4/10/23, 3:17:10 PM] ‪+91 96037 58691‬: @18123409769 Hey, Amy! Do we have to login with username and paraphrase in order to accept the admit offer through the decision form?
[4/10/23, 3:25:35 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: No, you just need to just click the link.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you use your application email address so that our system reads you as one person instead of someone new.  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 3:27:00 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If you upload a new document, this will cause your "case" to drop down in the queue for OIS.  OIS processes documents in the order in which they are received. Does that make sense?  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 3:28:22 PM] ‪+1 (945) 239‑5699‬: +1
[4/10/23, 3:29:39 PM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: So for suppose if I have uploaded 3 documents individually instead of one go, then it will create a drop-down showing the documents right?
[4/10/23, 3:33:52 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: I am not sure of this.  I cannot "see" what you see since I do not have an Atlas account.  It may be best to reach out to OIS directly with your questions.  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 3:40:23 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: We do not require LORs.  We already have them in your application.  About your transcripts, please see the following:

[4/10/23, 4:10:05 PM] ‪+91 77018 25520‬: So are you saying, we don't need to mail transcripts and related docs, if we are planning to show the hard copy directly on campus ??
[4/10/23, 4:14:54 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: OIS does like to see hard copy documents directly from your universities but if you have "once in a lifetime" documents, please hand carry them to campus.  Know that they required marksheets, degree conferrals as well as transcripts. ~Amy
[4/10/23, 4:17:45 PM] ‪+91 77018 25520‬: Thank you for this info :) So this delay in showing documents will not disturb my admission process or course registration, right?
[4/10/23, 4:23:14 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is always a "grey area" of when students can set up their IU email account.  In most cases,  a day or two after your documents are approved, students can set up their email account.  I say a day or two as it can take that long for all of our systems to synch up/update.  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 4:24:48 PM] ‪+91 79012 86039‬: @18123409769  does conferred degree is necessary, if yes does it need to be kept in sealed envelope?
[4/10/23, 4:31:29 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: In our system, you need to show as "Matriculated" in order to set up your IU email account.  This happens after your documents are approved.  So far, I am not seeing either of you as "matriculated" yet.  I am not sure where you are seeing your documents as approved (I cannot see that part of your accounts). ~Amy
[4/10/23, 4:32:48 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Sealed envelopes are great but not mandatory.  Official documents only.  Copies are not acceptable under any circumstance. ~Amy
[4/10/23, 4:34:03 PM] ‪+91 79012 86039‬: Yes but does the degree conferred Letter is once in a lifetime document, we can't submit it anywhere right .
[4/10/23, 4:36:43 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If the loan is in the student's name, it is considered personal funding. If it's in the name of someone else, it'd be treated as funding from family/friend.

[4/10/23, 5:27:23 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: In order to download the I20, your daughter (if I followed the chat correctly) needs to create her IU email address.  Once it is activated, she can download her I20.  ~Amy
[4/10/23, 6:50:20 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: I dont think so it is going to affect anyone since we are given admit for Bloomington campus and moreover the Computer Science program at IUPUI is offered by School of Science not by Luddy School
[4/10/23, 8:28:34 PM] ‪+91 80748 67024‬: I applied for both Data Science and Computer Science.

When I emailed OIS asking for an update a few weeks ago, they replied with:
"...... Once your application is complete and you have been admitted, we can begin reviewing your financial documentation for your immigration document .....".

I submitted financial documentation for both the programs on Atlas.

My doubt(from their reply), Are the OIS waiting for the CS decision to proceed verifying my financial documentation?
Because, they said something like  "..once i have been admitted.."
But I was already admitted.

Is this a bug on Atlas?
Can someone from luddy help me, plz.! @18123409769 @18122726195

If you admit letter was not sent until March, then they will need to wait for the admit letter.  Do not re-submit your financial docs.  If there are any issues, OIS will reach out to you directly.

[4/11/23, 12:04:39 PM] ‪+91 98920 07116‬: Which program is this?

[4/11/23, 12:05:49 PM] ‪+91 77018 25520‬: @18123409769 Hey Amy, I will be applying for a student loan this week, it might take around 2 weeks to get sanctioned, which might further delay my I20 process. In order to avoid this, what if I upload my parents bank statements that have sufficient funds to support my total expenses as financial docs...just in order to process the I20 faster, but later decide to go for a student loan, will I be allowed to make that change?
[4/11/23, 12:07:01 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: That is correct. This is straight off the OIS website... "Although proof of funding is required for only the first year, you are expected to fund your studies for the duration of your program. When adding up your expenses, remember that you should not look to employment as a means of support. Not only do you need authorization before you can start a job, but you are also limited in the number of hours you can work."  A typical grad student semester is 9 credits.  ~Amy

[4/11/23, 12:40:38 PM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: How true is this?
[4/11/23, 12:43:14 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: I personally am not a fan of this "calculator" since it is university wide and not just Luddy.  I would suggest using the table that was sent in your welcome packet.  That is as precise as we can make it.  Your living expenses will vary with your personal habits, but this is pretty accurate.  Also, please note that these numbers are for 2022-2023.  The Board of Trustees will meet in June to assess tuition costs, so there may be a small increase, if any. ~Amy
[4/11/23, 12:44:42 PM] ‪+1 (954) 536‑4846‬: Thank you for the confirmation Amy!
[4/11/23, 12:46:16 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: This covers how many credits??
[4/11/23, 12:46:18 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: 18 right?
[4/11/23, 12:48:22 PM] ‪+91 93471 61811‬: Why does IUB take too long to issue the i20 whereas most of the universities are processing the i20 within 2-3 weeks tops.
[4/11/23, 12:49:41 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[4/11/23, 12:49:46 PM] ‪+91 98920 07116‬: This is the cost for two sem so ig it is 18 credits
[4/11/23, 12:50:07 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Since OIS handles 9 Universities that come under IU Umbrella
[4/11/23, 12:51:18 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is very true! I strongly encourage everyone to only have one I20 and that to the school you TRULY wish to attend.  It is not feasible to have an I20 to XXX school and then try to transfer to ZZZ school, especially in a graduate program since it is only two years.  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 12:52:36 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Ohkay thanks
[4/11/23, 12:52:40 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Thank youuu
[4/11/23, 12:58:42 PM] ‪+91 80733 07973‬: @18123409769 Hey Amy
Hope to get an answer on this
[4/11/23, 12:59:42 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Our OIS office handles all the I20 documents for all nine IU campuses.  To put it in perspective, IUB campus has over 5k international students alone.  Graduate and undergraduate.  IUPUI has over 2k.  Now add seven more campuses...  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 1:00:50 PM] ‪+91 93986 56159‬: Here it is mentioned that if we have received multiple i20's then we can mail the university and cancel the i20 before VI. Can this be done?
[4/11/23, 1:00:56 PM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: Cool thanks
[4/11/23, 1:02:01 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Two semesters with 9/credits per semester.  Plan accordingly if you want to take a summer course or plan to stay in US for the summer (living expenses). ~Amy

[4/11/23, 1:04:16 PM] ‪+91 93986 56159‬: Can anyone confirm if this is possible?
[4/11/23, 1:04:39 PM] ‪+91 83569 61461‬: @18123409769 or anyone can please answer
[4/11/23, 1:04:48 PM] ‪+91 86899 83389‬: .
[4/11/23, 1:05:37 PM] ‪+91 98920 07116‬: So for the second year there will be only 12 credits left so eventually the tuition cost will decrease right?
[4/11/23, 1:05:44 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Yup
[4/11/23, 1:05:50 PM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: Hey @18123409769 Amy, I submitted the google form for admit decision yesterday. I haven’t received any mail regarding the atlas portal that students have mentioned here. Who should I reach out for this? Not sure about the next steps from here.
[4/11/23, 1:06:30 PM] ‪+91 93612 87628‬: yeah we can , afaik we just need to fill in the ID from the attending i-20 in the DS-160 form and we are good to go

[4/11/23, 1:07:23 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: You can get I20 based on your parents funds and later for visa you can show loan
[4/11/23, 1:08:00 PM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: Small doubt I can show the bank certificate in INR also right it’s not mandatory to show in USD?? @18123409769 could you please clarify on this?
[4/11/23, 1:08:23 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: No
[4/11/23, 1:08:38 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: There is no co op in IUB

[4/11/23, 1:08:51 PM] ‪+91 6385 186 039‬: This is exactly what I’m doing. My parents savings is sufficient for the i20 amount but we have to show 2x that for the vida right? So would doing this be okay?  @18123409769 ?
[4/11/23, 1:08:51 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: For internship we are eligible only in Summer break
[4/11/23, 1:09:01 PM] ‪+91 93986 56159‬: But the visa officer will know that we have multiple i20's. So once we decide the final university, can we cancel the remaining i20's by mailing the college?
[4/11/23, 1:09:36 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes its fine
[4/11/23, 1:09:54 PM] ‪+91 98205 40980‬: The student decision form mentioned in the admit letter
[4/11/23, 1:10:22 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you show 2x for i20 also in your I20 they will mention only that much fund that is needed
[4/11/23, 1:11:12 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you mention $80k also for Financial docs your I20 will only show $49227 only
[4/11/23, 1:11:31 PM] ‪+91 6385 186 039‬: But that’s just for 1 year right?
[4/11/23, 1:11:49 PM] ‪+91 6385 186 039‬: Okay, so we don’t have to show 2x during the visa interview then?
[4/11/23, 1:12:14 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: We have to show to VO not to OIS
[4/11/23, 1:12:23 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: OIS only need 1 yr fund
[4/11/23, 1:12:41 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: VO need guarantee of sufficient funds for complete course
[4/11/23, 1:12:48 PM] ‪+91 6385 186 039‬: Okay got it. Thank you! 👍

[4/11/23, 2:19:58 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is done by OIS.  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 2:21:19 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: It can be done, but at the same time, you are putting the colleges through a lot of unnecessary work to prep your I20(s) for you to simply cancel them later.  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 2:21:35 PM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: It can be done in fall semester of second year
[4/11/23, 2:21:51 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Completed by OIS.
[4/11/23, 2:22:50 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Typically in your last semester.  Your visa requirements will also change a bit in the last semester. ~Amy

[4/11/23, 2:27:13 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Congrats, which couse and when did you submitted Financial docs?
[4/11/23, 2:27:20 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: My understanding on this is very limited.  Please remember I do not work with OIS, I work with Recruitment and Admissions!  I believe you will be ok with updating your financials as long as the people funding you remain the same (like your parents or whoever is assisting you).
[4/11/23, 2:27:44 PM] ‪+91 84335 34715‬: Msds, I submitted them long back, don't remember the dates

[4/11/23, 2:29:32 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: From OIS website:  Information about your source(s) of funding
When gathering your financial documentation, please keep the following items in mind:

You should include bank statements if at all possible.
You must submit only legible financial documentation.
You may be asked to submit original documents at Indiana University’s discretion.
You must provide the specific amount and currency of available funds, though funds on bank statements, etc., do not need to be shown in U.S. dollars.
You must submit documentation from the 12 months preceding the time you intend to enroll.
If the available sponsored funds do not completely cover your incurred costs, you will be responsible for all additional expenses associated with your stay in the United States.

[4/11/23, 2:33:37 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: You have to manage your regular credit with internship
[4/11/23, 2:33:42 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: No, the admission letter is quite different than what is listed here from the Atlas page.  The admit letter is for your to either accept or decline.  The "Finalized Admission" is part of the Atlas system that OIS handles.  ~amy
[4/11/23, 2:33:49 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Not like dedicated co op program
[4/11/23, 2:34:14 PM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: Co op, according to my understanding is doing a internship during your academic semester, Correct me if I am wrong

[4/11/23, 2:35:37 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Reach out to the student ambassadors.  What you term as Co-op may be different here.  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 2:36:09 PM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: Exactly
[4/11/23, 2:36:55 PM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: I heard from a current student that they are allowed to do so and get 1 credit for it.
[4/11/23, 2:38:38 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: As per me co op is something where you Dont have to attend University classes and work like a Full time employee with some exceptions
[4/11/23, 2:38:55 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: That too during academic sem
[4/11/23, 2:39:27 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: But here at IUB we have to do complete our usual credits also
[4/11/23, 2:39:38 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Sem credits
[4/11/23, 2:40:28 PM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: That concept comes from neu and it doesn't exists everywhere, some other private universities allow similar opportunities
[4/11/23, 2:40:54 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes so thats what co op is
[4/11/23, 2:41:26 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: This is just you are doing normal intership with your academic curriculum
[4/11/23, 2:45:54 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: My understanding is the visa officer will see your SEVIS on record.  It needs to match the I20/school that you plan to attend in the US.  ~Amy
[4/11/23, 2:46:53 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If your parents are listed on your loan, then no issue. ~Amy

[4/11/23, 3:01:00 PM] ‪+91 98222 11926‬: Guy's how many days after uploading the dataset you guy's got the i20 ??
[4/11/23, 3:11:13 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is not a set amount of time.  Every case is different.  In general, it can take 2-4 weeks from when OIS has received all your documents (including admit letter from our team) to get approval.  It can then be another 2-4 weeks for your I20.  In many cases, this is quicker.  I like to err on the side of longer. ~Amy
[4/11/23, 3:12:12 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Did you receive an email from OIS telling you to download your I20?  Also, you would use your IU email to access it. ~Amy

I have the loan sanction letter and my bank statement to be uploaded in the financial documents.

Which section should I upload them? The loan is in my name.

I can see only one upload position under personal funding. 
Thank for reading!
[4/12/23, 9:33:40 AM] ‪+91 98441 71183‬: If your loan sanction letter covers the amount mentioned in atlas
Then only upload that under personal funding cause the loan is in your name
[4/12/23, 9:35:17 AM] ‪+91 98345 51196‬: The loan is for lesser amount.
[4/12/23, 9:38:11 AM] ‪+91 98441 71183‬: Then just combine the pdf with your statement and upload it there itself
[4/12/23, 9:38:27 AM] ‪+91 98441 71183‬: And in financial declarations mention your funds and who its coming from

I am thinking you will also need to have your SEVIS transferred, so you will need to contact OIS directly for more information and assistance with that.

Should I Provide Funding for Both Years of My Graduate Study When Submitting Financial Documents, or Is Just One Year Enough?
[4/12/23, 11:23:33 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: One year is enough
[4/12/23, 11:24:54 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Happy to help! Wish I could more.  ~Amy
[4/12/23, 11:25:40 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Per the OIS website:  Required financial documents
Once you are accepted at Indiana University, you will be required to submit documents proving you have the financial means to support yourself for a full calendar year, including tuition, fees, and living expenses.

Your financial documents are not related to your admission decision. However, OIS cannot issue you an immigration document until you have provided sufficient evidence of financial support. We encourage you to submit your financial documents as soon as possible. We will be able to finalize your application and process your necessary immigration documents sooner.

Although proof of funding is required for only the first year, you are expected to fund your studies for the duration of your program. When adding up your expenses, remember that you should not look to employment as a means of support. Not only do you need authorization before you can start a job, but you are also limited in the number of hours you can work.
[4/12/23, 11:28:33 AM] ‪+91 88385 62603‬: Hey, I submitted financial document two days back,.any idea when I can get it validated please,.
[4/12/23, 11:30:33 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: It may take 2-4 weeks to approve your documents

[4/12/23, 11:31:55 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: It is taking 2-4 weeks for the OIS to approve your docs. After your financial documentation has been approved, the OIS will start working on your I20. It is taking the OIS 2-4 weeks to process an I20. Be sure to check your email and your Atlas account for updates on a regular basis.  Generally, it does not take the full guessimated time, but I like to err on the long side.  ~Amy

[4/13/23, 4:33:17 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: I am seeing that your docs are not approved yet.  OIS will have begun working on your documents when they received your admit letter (from our office), not back in January.   ~Amy
[4/13/23, 4:37:15 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Per OIS:  "If the loan is in the student's name, it is considered personal funding. If it's in the name of someone else, it'd be treated as funding from family/friend. "  ~Amy
[4/13/23, 4:43:20 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: It is more of a quiz that you take right after the session. It is brand new this coming semester so I really do not know what will be on it.  It is about not cheating, plagiarism etc.  ~Amy

[4/13/23, 4:49:47 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi Nithi.  I can see that you applied to both IUB and IUPUI.  We have your acceptance here at IUB, but you should let IUPUI know you are declining their offer (if that is still your decision).  This will help OIS to process your I20 for the correct school/program. ~Amy

[4/14/23, 2:37:07 AM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: It doesn't matter when you submitted your documents before receiving your admit, they start reviewing only after you receive your admit
[4/14/23, 2:37:20 AM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: I did that, they said I am missing documents. So I reached out to goluddy and they said there too many applications hence ois hasn’t received my application yet. 

I think I should write to them again. This is all too confusing.

[4/14/23, 10:29:23 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: OIS takes 2-4 weeks to approve financial documents and will take another 2-3 weeks to generate i20
[4/14/23, 10:29:44 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: So keep checking your atlas for financial documents approval
[4/14/23, 10:32:54 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: Yeah and it is a hell of a lot of time compared to all other unis, I am kind of worried about my visa now

[4/14/23, 10:37:24 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: That timeframe is most likely exaggerated for most of you.  I would rather err on the side of more time and have you surprised when it is ready.  Also, our OIS processes all of the I20s for all NINE campuses, not just Bloomington.  So that is over 10, 000 I20s.... most other univerisities do not have that volume. ~Amy
[4/14/23, 10:38:30 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Also, note... we see this EVERY year and our students do get here... even during Covid.  So stay positive and as Aditya said... have hope. ~Amy

[4/17/23, 9:22:54 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Same is mentioned here
[4/17/23, 9:28:28 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Yeah it's same from beginning.. but the info in welcome packet is expired
[4/17/23, 9:29:05 AM] ‪+91 76618 62440‬: Yeah
[4/17/23, 9:39:38 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: But for i20, they always put in additional amount for living and tuition fees right? I was in an assumption that it's the welcome packet that has to be considered and not i20 which is only for showing enough funds. (Correct me if I am wrong pls)
[4/17/23, 9:40:27 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Living is showing on higher side but tution is same
[4/17/23, 9:46:49 AM] ‪+91 81600 03879‬: Almost 290k increased in INR including taxes.
[4/17/23, 9:49:05 AM] ‪+91 91 82664 566‬: Isn't this the health insurance and not per credit fee?
[4/17/23, 9:49:44 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: You are looking 2 different columns
[4/17/23, 9:50:32 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Per credit is calculated by dividing the tuition by 18 credits i.e. 32626/18 = 1812$
[4/17/23, 9:51:03 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Which is a rough idea because each subject has different fee
[4/17/23, 9:52:08 AM] ‪+91 96524 78678‬: So just the tuition costs around 45 Lakhs 
And with health insurance n international student fees it will go upto 50 Lakhs ?
[4/17/23, 9:53:28 AM] ‪+91 98345 51196‬: Yes.
[4/17/23, 9:53:30 AM] ‪+91 97634 85674‬: Consider 47 lakhs actually because the conversion rate and margin also needs to be considered
[4/17/23, 9:53:39 AM] ‪+91 91 82664 566‬: Please can you share the link to this?
[4/17/23, 9:53:40 AM] ‪+91 97634 85674‬: For tuition
[4/17/23, 9:54:23 AM] ‪+91 97634 85674‬: Should be based on the number of credits itself
[4/17/23, 9:54:34 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: There is link this is the message from some of my friends who are studying
[4/17/23, 9:55:15 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Yeah but some subject are expensive while some are cheaper so after all it's avg at last

[4/17/23, 9:55:25 AM] ‪+91 91 82664 566‬: Okay
[4/17/23, 9:55:54 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Also there are miscellaneous charges to consider

[4/17/23, 10:05:57 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I told based on what Amy said in last webinar
[4/17/23, 10:06:57 AM] ‪+91 77578 58565‬: Yeah I am not saying that you are wrong just stating that removing one charge won't make a huge difference

[4/17/23, 11:26:59 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Not true.  You may hand carry them, but it preferable to have them sent directly to OIS.  This helps them to be able to verify them quicker since they are direct from your university.  If you hand carry them, you will need to make an appointment to drop them off when you arrive on campus.  ~Amy

[4/17/23, 12:15:14 PM] ‪+91 79812 54155‬: So here it says *outside of Indiana* $29250 per 18 credits. But it financial docs it says $32626 per year. So can you please mention what's the per credit fees?
[4/17/23, 12:17:37 PM] ‪+91 99624 49511‬: This is 2022 to 2023 academic year i e.. last year fee details

[4/18/23, 10:47:56 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: @18123409769    Since the fees have changed (increased) for the past 2 years going from 1.6k to 1.8k usd per credit will this trend continue?

[4/18/23, 11:26:22 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hello Trinay.  Your application date does not having any bearing on where you fall in the queue with OIS.  It looks like your letter was sent to you mid-March. If you had your fin docs uploaded at that time, OIS will then begin working on your docs.  Remember that they cannot work on everyone's on the same day, that is just not possible with the number of International students that come to Luddy and IU overall.  So, please try not to worry.  You will receive your I20.  OIS is buried in emails at this time and may take 14 days to respond to you.  When a department receives over 700 emails per day, they tend to get behind.  😔  ~Amy

If you still need to get vaccinations done, I would work on getting them now.  Especially those that may require a booster (extra time needed).  You HAVE TO HAVE ALL of your vaccinations up to date (and uploaded) by the time you register for SPRING 2024.  This is a strict policy and there are no exceptions or extensions on vaccinations.

The loan letter was on my name and my parents name as well, but i did not submit the declaration form instead i submitted under self funding. Is this causing delay, should i submit the declaration form? Is it possible to check my status? Thank you

[4/20/23, 4:22:22 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: My understanding is that the loans do not require the Declaration form. This is from the OIS website:  
Details about personal or family funding
If full or partial funding is coming from personal sources (for example, family or friends), each person who will provide your financial support must:

Sign the Declaration of Financial Support form.
Attach an official bank statement(s). The name on the declaration must match the account holder on the bank statement(s).
Bank statements must be in English. Each bank statement submitted must include the following details:

The name of your financial supporter. The translated name must be on the original document (not handwritten in).
The date. Documents must be dated no more than one year (12 months) prior to the date classes begin for the desired term of enrollment.
The amount of available funds and the type of currency.
The name of the bank. The name of the bank must be officially indicated on the bank statement.
[4/20/23, 4:22:31 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Details about educational loans
Educational loans are acceptable for submission as proof of financial support and will be used to finalize admission. Sanctioned loan letters must clearly indicate the loan as “approved” or “sanctioned” before we will create your immigration document. The letter must be in English and on official bank or institution letterhead.

We are also unable to accept in-principle sanction letters to create an immigration document. In-principle does not officially affirm that the loan has been finalized. The letter must be in English and on official bank or institution letterhead.

[4/21/23, 2:53:41 AM] Nivedhita IUB CS: Hi guys

[4/21/23, 2:54:24 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Ur fee structure
[4/21/23, 3:05:35 AM] ‪+91 88277 06460‬: Anyone who’s planning to take education loan but has added FDs and sponser letters in financial docs?
[4/21/23, 3:05:55 AM] ‪+91 90110 69724‬: Me!
[4/21/23, 3:05:58 AM] ‪+91 98331 60952‬: ✋
[4/21/23, 3:06:01 AM] ‪+91 97636 19554‬: Me!
[4/21/23, 3:06:11 AM] ‪+91 95531 70844‬: ✋🏻
[4/21/23, 3:06:18 AM] ‪+91 90110 69724‬: Deciding a loaner has been tedious
[4/21/23, 3:06:35 AM] ‪+91 88277 06460‬: My docs are approved. Won’t be an issue if I take a loan now right?
[4/21/23, 3:07:00 AM] ‪+91 88277 06460‬: I’m going for UBI
[4/21/23, 3:08:03 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I have taken from UBI
[4/21/23, 3:08:25 AM] ‪+91 80964 31747‬: What's the roi bro
[4/21/23, 3:08:33 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: 9.8
[4/21/23, 3:08:35 AM] ‪+91 90110 69724‬: Ohh, I haven’t looked into that one at all. Thanks a ton!
[4/21/23, 3:08:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Without collateral
[4/21/23, 3:08:57 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But only 40 lakh
[4/21/23, 3:09:13 AM] ‪+91 80964 31747‬: Ohh ok..do they have any processing fee
[4/21/23, 3:12:31 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: 5k will be charged but it will get reversed if you take loan within 3 months of sanction date
[4/21/23, 3:13:02 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And further you need to bear cost for Insurance too and btw insurance is common in all education loan
[4/21/23, 3:13:36 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Yes even for collateral loans
[4/21/23, 3:14:06 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[4/21/23, 3:15:05 AM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: For financial docs we just need to show funds sufficient for 1st year or both years to get the i20?
[4/21/23, 3:15:18 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Actually they are too smart.
It is very difficult for us to disburse the loan with in 3 months because the university has some specific date to accept the semester fee. So getting that 5k back is tricky as far as I know
[4/21/23, 3:15:32 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: 1st year
[4/21/23, 3:16:16 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: As of now my BM has not deducted that 5k from my account
[4/21/23, 3:16:37 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But I already got sanction letter on 6th April
[4/21/23, 3:17:09 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: So your deadline would be around 7th July
[4/21/23, 3:17:43 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Lets see
[4/21/23, 3:17:47 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: If you want a loan above 40lakh what is the interest rate they conveyed
[4/21/23, 3:18:04 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But 5k is minimal infront of 45-60k
[4/21/23, 3:18:35 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: This is true.
[4/21/23, 3:18:37 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I think its 9.3 or 9.5 not sure
[4/21/23, 3:19:12 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: What!!
[4/21/23, 3:19:18 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I haven't inquired much on that since I am not showing any collateral
[4/21/23, 3:19:30 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: You took for 9.8
[4/21/23, 3:19:35 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: ??
[4/21/23, 3:19:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[4/21/23, 3:19:59 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: And above 40 lakh is lesser than what you have taken... Iam confused
[4/21/23, 3:20:31 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Ig you will be giving security for that right
[4/21/23, 3:20:47 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: You can check with bank once even I am not sure on that part
[4/21/23, 3:20:50 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Ohh acha.
[4/21/23, 3:21:02 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But for non collateral its 9.8 thats for sure
[4/21/23, 3:21:19 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Yeah I heard that there is a limit for union bank for non secured loans
[4/21/23, 3:21:22 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: If u want 50L, u need to show partial collateral and ROI is above 10
[4/21/23, 3:21:48 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: 40lakh
[4/21/23, 3:22:16 AM] ‪+91 95662 12535‬: Same
[4/21/23, 3:22:33 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: This might be for premium institutes. Since IUB is listed in premium institutes the ROI is less
[4/21/23, 3:22:40 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[4/21/23, 4:13:14 AM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: Okay 👍
[4/21/23, 4:39:58 AM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: People who’ve given bank certificates for finacial documents, was the amount mentioned in usd or inr?

[4/21/23, 4:40:37 AM] ‪+91 89793 00287‬: Both in inr as well as usd
[4/21/23, 4:40:43 AM] ‪+91 91 3009 960 6‬: Usd conversion is mentioned below for the total amount
[4/21/23, 4:41:08 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Its not mandatory to do that

[4/21/23, 4:48:24 AM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: I’m going to SBI, I think they ll anyway do what they’d like, I’ll still ask though 🙈
[4/21/23, 4:50:14 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: This is really a valid point.. 😅
We can't question them back. They say some or the other reason for those hidden charges.
[4/21/23, 4:51:26 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: So SBI bank is a better choice
[4/21/23, 4:51:57 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: But since it is a govt bank response will be too slow unlike private banks
[4/21/23, 4:58:02 AM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: It can be mentioned either in INR or USD not mandatory to show in USD
[4/21/23, 4:58:14 AM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: Great thanks
[4/21/23, 4:59:14 AM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: Ideally how much did you guys got the sanctioned amount?
[4/21/23, 4:59:22 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: I mentioned in both
[4/21/23, 4:59:22 AM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: For non collateral
[4/21/23, 5:04:11 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Me 40lakh
[4/21/23, 5:05:53 AM] ‪+91 6352 419 455‬: Get it mentioned in both currency. Approach manager directly as it falls under his job.
[4/21/23, 5:06:10 AM] ‪+91 6352 419 455‬: his/her*
[4/21/23, 5:09:46 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Frankly their rates are high, u should try union Bank or axis Bank or even Bank of Baroda
[4/21/23, 5:12:01 AM] ‪+91 75886 18649‬: For girls Union Bank gives even lesser ROI
[4/21/23, 5:19:35 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: .5 less than normal rate

I had some questions about finacial documents 
Im uploading sanction letter as financial document about 60945$ is the amount do I need to add my personal bank statement along with it too ?
If yes 
Personal bank statement means all the transaction report for past 6 months or just the certificate from bank stating the amount in my account is sufficient?
And what would be the minimum amount which we can show in my personal bank account in dollars to get the I20 considering amount given in loan sanction letter ?

Thank you for your help in advance! 😊
[4/22/23, 4:02:07 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: This loan is itself enough for i20

[4/22/23, 4:02:45 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Anything greater than that is sufficient

[4/24/23, 2:00:27 AM] Dilip Nikhil: I don't think so man, but you can work on campus anywhere you want! 20hrs a week, and upto 40 during summers!
[4/24/23, 2:00:39 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: On F1 visa you are not allowed to work off campus
[4/24/23, 2:01:24 AM] Dilip Nikhil: you can, but get ready to be escorted back to India!
[4/24/23, 2:01:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: But after completing 1 academic year you can file for CPT permit which will allow you to work in relevant field for 40/hr per week as internship
[4/24/23, 2:01:56 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Thats on cash basis and its illegal as per norms
[4/24/23, 2:02:18 AM] ‪+91 96112 07402‬: Yep
[4/24/23, 2:02:59 AM] ‪+91 96112 07402‬: I thought part time, after 9 months should be doable
[4/24/23, 2:03:18 AM] ‪+971 50 114 6456‬: 9 months is one academic year
[4/24/23, 2:03:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you only want part time you can do on campus only
[4/24/23, 2:03:43 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes

[4/24/23, 2:05:15 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: For on campus part time you don't need CPT
[4/24/23, 2:08:51 AM] ‪+91 90593 97854‬: +1
[4/24/23, 2:10:07 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Can we do part time on campus upto 40 hrs during breaks??
[4/24/23, 2:10:50 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: For working 40hrs you need CPT
[4/24/23, 2:11:12 AM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: wts CPT again?
[4/24/23, 2:11:38 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And getting CPT is only possible if you job in relevant field
[4/24/23, 2:11:54 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Its work permit during studies
[4/24/23, 2:12:15 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Not actually during studies but during break
[4/24/23, 2:12:53 AM] Dilip Nikhil: Optional and Curriculum Practical Training! These are the ABCs that one should know before applying to US.
[4/24/23, 2:13:33 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: https://yocket.com/blog/opt-and-cpt

[4/24/23, 2:18:14 AM] ‪+91 79812 54155‬: How difficult is it to get on-campus part time at IUB?
[4/24/23, 2:18:40 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Its not hard thats what I heard
[4/24/23, 2:18:45 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: There are plenty of opportunities
[4/24/23, 2:20:00 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Can I work 20 hrs in part time during breaks??
[4/24/23, 2:22:12 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: On-campus employment with a US student visa
Your US student visa allows you to work on-campus up to 20 hours per week when school is in session and full-time during school break periods (up to 40 hours per week).

On-campus employment is defined as work that takes place on campus, or at an off-campus location that is affiliated with the school. That could mean working in a university bookstore, cafeteria or other facilities where students can help.
[4/24/23, 2:22:23 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Hope this answers your question
[4/24/23, 2:25:01 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Totally!!!!!

Quick question - Can we have different funding sources for I20 application and for visa process ?
[4/24/23, 2:52:37 AM] Dilip Nikhil: Yes you can.
[4/24/23, 2:52:56 AM] ‪+91 95452 49996‬: Okay, thank you !
[4/24/23, 3:05:23 AM] ‪+91 90593 97854‬: but prepare a valid reason, if the VO asks you
[4/24/23, 3:36:26 AM] ‪+91 91 79986 144‬: After getting CPT I can work off-campus for 20 hrs/week if I'm not wrong.
And that will be from 2nd year
[4/24/23, 3:38:08 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes you can but that work should be relevant to your field of study
[4/24/23, 3:38:22 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And upto 40hrs per week you can work
[4/24/23, 3:47:45 AM] ‪+91 77189 87190‬: Can anyone let me know that on the bank loan sanction letter, is the name of University required?
[4/24/23, 3:48:37 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: No
[4/24/23, 3:49:18 AM] ‪+91 77189 87190‬: So just a letter stating that I will be sanctioned a loan of xyz amount enough for financial document?
[4/24/23, 3:49:51 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: But, Once you finalize your university, you must inform your bank to get you a Sanction letter with the university name.
[4/24/23, 3:50:19 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: Yes, for i20, it is enough.

[4/24/23, 8:28:54 AM] ‪+91 99135 03594‬: Don't know if there's any issue with our submissions or is it just normal, would help if we could atleast get some confirmation on that
[4/24/23, 8:29:37 AM] ‪+91 95123 17178‬: Ikr I just want to know the order in which they are processing it. It's very haphazard.
[4/24/23, 8:30:58 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Might be they are verifying with Banks probably
[4/24/23, 8:31:03 AM] ‪+91 80964 31747‬: My docs got approved but to generate i20 they where saying final decision documents from the deans  office are yet to arrive..

[4/24/23, 8:32:15 AM] ‪+91 6354 068 668‬: Only approval is taking this much time. Then our i20 will take ages
[4/24/23, 8:33:52 AM] ‪+91 83558 61148‬: Think about me man, I'm yet to upload financial docs
[4/24/23, 8:34:02 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Generating i20 seems to be faster compared to approval of docs

[4/27/23, 6:48:54 AM] Dilip Nikhil: might have an update by next week!
[4/27/23, 6:49:24 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Before itself you should ask and confirm. Later these people will increase it.
[4/27/23, 6:50:05 AM] Dilip Nikhil: that's fair! but I can always refuse!
[4/27/23, 6:50:49 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Yeah. But your credit score will get affected if there are many enquiries from various banks
[4/27/23, 6:54:16 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Because each hard enquiry counts
[4/27/23, 6:58:17 AM] ‪+91 83558 61148‬: 0.5%+gst
[4/27/23, 6:58:26 AM] ‪+91 83558 61148‬: I did, they're not giving loan above 40lacs
[4/27/23, 6:59:05 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: If you are sticking with iub and you don't have requirement above 40 lakh i would strongly suggest to go with Union bank of india because their interest rate is very low which is EFBR + 0.5% And "0" processing fee
[4/27/23, 6:59:44 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: EFBR - standard RBI rate which is 9.3% as of now
[4/27/23, 7:00:46 AM] ‪+971 50 114 6456‬: Is this with collateral?
[4/27/23, 7:01:00 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Non - colletral

[4/27/23, 7:02:18 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: If you provide colletral which is 50% of your loan value then 0.25% concession. If you provide with 100% of the value you will get 0.5% concession

[4/27/23, 7:03:50 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Dude make sure it has 15% margin also
[4/27/23, 7:04:27 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Yeah.. but you don't have to keep it always
[4/27/23, 7:04:58 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: While disbursing if you can provide 15% it is enough
[4/27/23, 7:05:01 AM] Dilip Nikhil: hey, can you explain this in brief,?
[4/27/23, 7:05:14 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: You dont have to keep but if you want for first sem suppose 18lakh then 15% of this 18 lakh you need to bring
[4/27/23, 7:05:38 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: There is no as such reason been told. But Amy has told that it will be mentioned like that and it is not wrong

[4/27/23, 7:06:07 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: For those who are inquiring ICICI roi is 10.85, and pf of 0.5% and no insurance included(you have to take separately)
[4/27/23, 7:06:36 AM] ‪+91 99749 59775‬: Oo okay fine.. Because in visa interviews many people got a questions from officer about this!

[4/28/23, 9:29:02 AM] ‪+91 73374 74606‬: Not yet
[4/28/23, 10:00:12 AM] ‪+91 98343 36338‬: I have a question in general, can we audit or attend lectures from other departments, say an economics or a business class, only for the knowledge? I am a cs student.
[4/28/23, 10:10:26 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: I wanted to ask about the insurance. Is it compulsory in IUB to take University insurance or we can have our own insurances?
[4/28/23, 10:10:57 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: university insurance is recommeded
[4/28/23, 10:11:19 AM] Dilip Nikhil: We can do this.
[4/28/23, 10:11:21 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Is it compulsory though?
[4/28/23, 10:11:36 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: But you can take insurance by yourself too.
[4/28/23, 10:11:38 AM] Dilip Nikhil: But the question is, will you have the time and energy to do it?
[4/28/23, 10:12:32 AM] ‪+91 99201 92465‬: You can choose your own insurances. But god forbid in an emergency situation, It would take time to process the insurance and you would have to wait till it is approved. So IUB insurance is recommended.
[4/28/23, 10:12:35 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Gotcha
[4/28/23, 10:12:36 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Thanksss
[4/28/23, 10:12:46 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: It is recommended to take insurance from University since they have better deals
[4/28/23, 10:13:04 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And its student friendly
[4/28/23, 10:13:06 AM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: Plus, if anything goes wrong, you have a university to support you if you have taken their insurance
[4/28/23, 10:13:14 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: True

Hi Amy 
My University ID is 2001067944. 
I got my i20 approval on my Atlas Account. 
While creating my IU Account there was a time out error right before submitting it. 

Now I’m not able to create the account again as it says my account already exists. And I am even not able to login using the credentials, the error message says “Failure to login”.

I have emailed ithelp@iu.edu regarding this issue. 
I wanted to know about the next steps to unlock and gain access to my account.
[4/28/23, 12:14:33 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Did you created your paraphrase?
[4/28/23, 12:14:39 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: I did
[4/28/23, 12:14:47 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: And when did you created your id?
[4/28/23, 12:14:50 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: I set up the Duo account also
[4/28/23, 12:15:29 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: Right after this there was a session time out and an error
[4/28/23, 12:15:34 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: Today
[4/28/23, 12:15:42 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Wait for 24hrs
[4/28/23, 12:15:48 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: So I’m not sure if it got saved or what exactly happened.
[4/28/23, 12:16:06 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: It clearly said the account could not be created
[4/28/23, 12:16:13 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Is it showing in your mobile?
[4/28/23, 12:16:24 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: While I tried creating again and these were the errors
[4/28/23, 12:16:28 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: If yes then your account is linked
[4/28/23, 12:16:47 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes just wait for 24hrs to get access
[4/28/23, 12:16:58 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: Ohh okay thanks
[4/28/23, 12:17:25 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: If that doesn't work probably you need to work with IT team
[4/28/23, 12:18:27 PM] ‪+91 75060 46148‬: I’ve emailed them as well but this is a bit concerning.
[4/28/23, 12:20:43 PM] ‪+91 98502 05536‬: My Financial Documents got approved today.
Passport and Address are still pending approval.

Documents submitted on 18th April.
[4/28/23, 12:34:07 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hey Shravani.  Excellent news on your I20!  As for your IU email account, you did well contacting UITS.  They will be able to assist you best. If you were just informed by OIS about your I20, it will be a few days before you can access in your Atlas portal.  ~Amy

For me it took 11 days.

I suggest it's better you send the whole through courier service (not originals, the official copies from university, stamped and sealed) or submit when you get there.

[5/2/23, 12:36:50 AM] ‪+91 85069 11853‬: Hi It's too frustrating to wait for the i20 after your docs got approved 3 weeks ago. Pls do take this matter seriously because it will affect our visa process as well as time of arrival.It seems there is no structural way to process these things  . ~Amy

[5/2/23, 12:42:26 AM] ‪+91 84649 10433‬: @18123409769 is that possible ? OIS said that my financials got approved on April 20th and in my portal it still showing submitted ! And they also said that u may not get the approved in your ATLAS portal !!
Is that possible ??

[5/2/23, 12:44:47 AM] ‪+91 85069 11853‬: It's possible that the visa slot may open soon if we didn't fill our CGI and SEVIS on before that happens we surely miss this fall entry. Pls ~Amy look at these matters seriously and pls do the needful.
[5/2/23, 12:48:16 AM] ‪+91 85069 11853‬: but after Aug 21. Dude we have other processes to do. this is not all about only i20.

[5/2/23, 5:28:42 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Its pretty long message
[5/2/23, 5:32:54 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Here's some generic advice about part-time jobs:

•    There's an internal IU website for all types of on-campus jobs, I think you can just search on one.iu.edu for "jobs". Try: https://jobs.iu.edu/
•    IU has plenty of catering and dining jobs and they’re usually looking for staff, so you should be able to get one.
•    It’s smart to start applying for any part time job as soon as possible. It’ll be helpful to get an SSN appointment ASAP.
•    For TA/RA jobs- Networking with Professors and current students will help loads! Just strike up a conversation and you'll be good to start. I’d recommend you go through the research interests of faculty and send them a polite introductory email.

Everyone gets jobs, but there's a lot of hustle involved for sure. You're very likely to get a part time job that helps you cover living expenses including rent, food, utilities. TA/RA jobs pay slightly more than dining jobs. All part-time jobs here are on an hourly basis and you can work at most 20 hrs/wk.

There are no specific student job boards. You can find open jobs (part time) on the One.IU website under IU Human Resources
https://hr.iu.edu/

Can first sem students get TA/RA?
Yes. If you convince the professor through cold emailing that you're a good fit as a TA for their class.

In dining job whats the time we have to work per week and whats the expected income?
The wage is around $12.5 and usually they give you a chance to select the number of hours you'd like to work.

[5/2/23, 10:36:43 AM] ‪+1 (269) 697‑3195‬: The process is not simply approving they need to create a document and send it to you.
[5/2/23, 10:36:54 AM] ‪+91 73509 61905‬: So is this means that our admission in Indiana university still not fixed? Even after we have submited the intent to enroll on time
[5/2/23, 10:37:00 AM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: As far as I know, IUB and OIS are two different departments. They are conveying that they didn't receive information yet from the IUB regarding your admission. They will update the next steps in Atlas portal once they receive the admission letter signed. You don't have to worry regarding your admission as far as I know. It is all their internal process.

[5/3/23, 8:03:26 AM] ‪+91 79788 21645‬: Hi
I’m very far behind in the entire process and I got for my financials ready but the portal isn’t letting me upload the documents. I accepted the admit before the decision period. Does this mean that I won’t be allowed to go through further process now?
[5/3/23, 8:03:58 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Whats the error you are getting?
[5/3/23, 8:04:30 AM] ‪+91 79788 21645‬: The “submit” option is not enabled
[5/3/23, 8:04:35 AM] ‪+91 79788 21645‬: It’s in grey
[5/3/23, 8:04:58 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Have you uploaded anything earlier?
[5/3/23, 8:05:14 AM] ‪+91 79788 21645‬: No
[5/3/23, 8:08:20 AM] ‪+91 97425 22557‬: May I know your source ?
[5/3/23, 8:21:32 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Guys, I am a bit confused regarding our fee structure.

It's all different in our i20 atlas, welcome packet and iub financial documentation

So, how do we know what exactly is the split up and the amount we need to pay per semester?
[5/3/23, 8:22:18 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Consider i20 as final amount
[5/3/23, 8:22:20 AM] ‪+91 97425 22557‬: welcome package has last year’s amount.
the one on website is right one and matches with i20.
‎[5/3/23, 8:25:40 AM] ‪+91 80964 31747‬: ‎image omitted
[5/3/23, 8:26:19 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Okay yeah that one matches.
So tuition plus mandatory fees is $32,626 for 18cr. 
And do we add health insurance amount to i20 or is it added in misc expenses as $ 3,884?
[5/3/23, 8:27:12 AM] ‪+91 99493 56199‬: When did you upload your financials and when were they approved?
[5/3/23, 8:27:13 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Health insurance isn't exactly compulsory to but
[5/3/23, 8:27:37 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Yes u add all expenses together
[5/3/23, 8:27:55 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: The more clear n consolidated ur document is the better for you
[5/3/23, 8:29:56 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Okay, thank youu!
[5/3/23, 8:31:34 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: It is compulsory
[5/3/23, 8:32:04 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: That amount will also be there in i20
[5/3/23, 8:32:31 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Under miscellaneous expenses ..?
[5/3/23, 8:32:48 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Whatever amount you see in Atlas covers all mandatory things including health insurance
[5/3/23, 8:32:49 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: I meant we don't need to actually buy it when college begins but it's necessary to show in the financial docs
[5/3/23, 8:33:49 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[5/3/23, 8:35:44 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Its highly recommended you go by Insurance provided by University
[5/3/23, 8:36:17 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Yes I understand that
[5/3/23, 8:40:08 AM] ‪+91 89719 27785‬: It's mandatory for international students to have medical insurance

[5/3/23, 3:41:38 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Looks like your documents are in the final review stage, so you should show as "matriculated" in our system soon.  ~Amy

But the course is "Computational Science" instead of Data Science. Will this cause any issues during Visa?Is there any proof that computational science is data science
[5/4/23, 1:23:04 AM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: i think amy had mentioned about this ..somewhere in the chat

[5/4/23, 1:24:44 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: If you are a Data Science - Residential MS student, on your I20 it will say "Computational Science."  This is CORRECT so please do not panic or think it is wrong.  Also, if you are an Intelligent Systems Engineering student, your I20 will show "Engineering, General." ~Amy
[5/4/23, 1:26:53 AM] ‪+91 88797 42474‬: I know, but I'm worried about visa. Cuz I'll have to say data science right, but on the i20 it's a different course, will it create any issues there?
[5/4/23, 1:28:26 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: No just mention what has any said . The visa officer will know it and understand that it is because of CIP code.
[5/4/23, 1:28:29 AM] ‪+91 77088 36614‬: It has to do with the CIP code that is set by the government.  Computational Science will be listed instead of Data Science - Residential on your I20. ~Amy

[5/5/23, 9:29:36 AM] ‪+91 81690 71606‬: Hi Amy, I've uploaded the financial documents for my I20, but there's a problem because my paperwork is printed with the surname "Katariya," while the bank certificate issued under my father's name has the surname "Kataria." 

I've mentioned the issue and attached the gazette copy (legal document for name change) along with the declaration form. I hope it won't be an issue for the approval.

[5/5/23, 2:40:24 PM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: I really think the only thing we can do is stay calm and cool. Because there is no way to expedite the process because it is a step by step process. They would be more aware about the visa process.

By the way one tip i would like to give is to start filling the CGI Portal and pay the visa fee with any other sevis id you have and don't fill ds 160 and don't pay sevis fee. You can later change the sevis id from the cgi portal unless you book the slot. But at least you can fill other details and be ready.
[5/5/23, 2:42:02 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: I think after booking slot also we can change Sevis id
[5/5/23, 2:42:49 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Correct.  All I20s will be electronic only!
[5/5/23, 2:42:57 PM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: Yeah but you gotta do that via mail, there is no computerised method or option on the portal for this
[5/5/23, 2:43:40 PM] ‪+91 77022 23359‬: Yes
[5/5/23, 2:44:26 PM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: Me too 😂
[5/5/23, 2:44:57 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you can't change Sevis Id after booking visa slot so I don't see any point in filling CGI with different I20
[5/5/23, 2:45:31 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi Soham.  I am not seeing that your IU email account has been set up yet.  You will need to do that.  ~Amy

[5/11/23, 9:48:28 AM] ‪+91 70326 61454‬: I know this has been asked before, but I just want to get it confirmed once and for all: what do we fill in the "Course of Study" field in the DS-160?

Is it the major listed on my I-20, or the name of the program on my admit letter?
[5/11/23, 9:49:43 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Use this link to get outlook access

[5/11/23, 9:52:17 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Always use the course of study you wish to enroll (name as per admit letter). 

We can always explain why it's different in the i20 alone!

[5/11/23, 9:53:33 AM] ‪+91 70326 61454‬: Ah, okay. Likewise, do we also mention the level of the course—that is, "MS in {$program_name}"?

[5/11/23, 9:53:52 AM] ‪+91 99728 18619‬: Oh ok

[5/11/23, 9:59:11 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Since in ds160, they didn't ask the program listed on i20
[5/11/23, 9:59:24 AM] Dilip Nikhil: I'm in the call, and I'm pretty sure she told to mention whatever is mentioned in i20 as ds160 is a state form.

I think it shouldn't be a problem.
[5/11/23, 10:01:27 AM] ‪+91 70326 61454‬: Although for computer science admits, I guess both will match. Do we also mention the number classification at the end of the I-20 major?

[5/19/23, 10:25:38 AM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: Hey guys,

Just wanted to give you a quick update on the doc. I've put together all the questions and doubts we've had during our application process and compiled them in this document. I went through our WhatsApp messages and added all the relevant info shared by Amy, as well as a bunch of useful stuff Aditya shared in the group to help us out.

I'm sharing the doc with you all, and hopefully, it'll be a great resource for anyone who still has questions.

Side note: I’ve only set up my email and I'm waiting for my i20. As I go further in the process, I'll be able to add more info. But if any of you had questions or doubts during your own process, please DM me and help me out so I can include that in the doc and make it even more helpful for others.

I’m hoping to keep this document updated so that it can help people even after us. Will appreciate all the help I can get!

Many times what you as a student see is vastly different than what I would see as a staff member.  Being able to blend the two has been extremely helpful to our team, but we are constantly learning new information or that a process has been changed by a department.  🙌😊 ~Amy

[5/20/23, 5:13:39 AM] ‪+91 86524 55659‬: It was not this airline right?

There's an online chat which you could do live and lay your complaint
[5/24/23, 10:16:06 AM] ‪+91 94938 79313‬: I tell my case! 

i did call the student center first:
812 - 855 -6500

i told them the issue like i am not able to enroll/ add to cart

they gave me the contact of my graduate recorder! 

i mailed him.

right after your phone call you will even get the transcript of your phone call to your mail id. so its better to attach that as a reference when you mail your graduate recorder
[5/24/23, 10:16:56 AM] ‪+91 74061 39928‬: is there any change in your dashboard?

[5/24/23, 1:03:39 PM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: Hello Guys, 

I have emailed *Professor Yuzhen Ye (Data Mining) and Professor David Leake (Elements of AI)* for the course syllabus. Will share that once I get the reply. I would suggest everyone to just drop the message here in the group if you have done the same. Because it becomes easy for the professor to answer 2-3 emails rather than answering multiple emails asking the same things. We can coordinate in this way and can get a detailed explanation about most of the course and thus, we can make a good choice for the classes we want to take this fall.

PS. Just Drop that you have emailed a particular professor, and we can discuss that over the discord channel.
[5/24/23, 1:04:43 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: I have emailed David Leake and Zoran Tiganj for course structure
[5/24/23, 1:04:46 PM] ‪+91 95884 12823‬: Could you create a google doc where you share the syllabus or a link that's accessible from the description?
[5/24/23, 1:05:44 PM] ‪+91 83209 88097‬: sure
[5/24/23, 1:06:16 PM] Dilip Nikhil: I have emailed Brad Luen for Higher stats course syllabus!

I have applied loan in sbi for the university name "a"

Can I use the same loan sanction letter I got for university "a" ?
Or should I inform the bank about changing my university ? 
My question is 
" is it okay to use the loan I got for university A but use it for university B ?"

[6/7/23, 7:24:45 AM] Raj Dhake: Immunization
1) Go to one.iu search for immunization
2) Create account with IU email
3) PROFILE SECTION=> Complete your profile details. Campus resident- select Yes. Requirement group - select Internation student.
4) Immunization & Testing Dates => Dont enter anything just scroll down, tick the check box and click on Submit dates and continue.
5) DOCUMENT SETION(complete step 4 before)- Download the Immunization form. Fill it with your doctor and get sign and hospital seal. No need for NPI no., the NPI licence no. and office number. Upload and submit.
6) Immunization & Testing Dates => Now fill in the dates (same as you mentioned in immunization form). Now again tick the check box and click on Submit dates and continue.
7) Wait and 2 days and check status.

Hope this helps. I have covered all the steps.
[6/7/23, 7:26:07 AM] ‪+91 93215 07575‬: Campus Resident should be 'No'
[6/7/23, 7:28:47 AM] Raj Dhake: I think if your program is online then select No

[6/7/23, 7:37:51 AM] ‪+91 93215 07575‬: I guess we need to get this confirmed because in my opinion, Campus Resident means it's asking us if we will live on-campus or not
[6/7/23, 7:39:02 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Buddy its better to give yes whether you are living off campus or on campus
[6/7/23, 7:39:09 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: You anyhow have to clear the immunization
[6/7/23, 7:39:20 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: It wont make any difference
[6/7/23, 7:41:58 AM] ‪+91 93215 07575‬: It's your call. I have selected 'No' after having a word with the Med+Proctor team and understanding what that term actually means
[6/7/23, 7:43:24 AM] ‪+91 93215 07575‬: But ig we can edit that later after re-visiting that page. So shouldn't be a point of concern for now

[6/7/23, 9:41:24 AM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: Test dates
[6/7/23, 9:41:47 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: If its titer you need to get the exemption form signed

[6/7/23, 9:43:44 AM] ‪+91 81971 65926‬: Exemption*
[6/7/23, 9:44:21 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: How to Submit an Exemption

Go to your Med+Proctor account or register if you have not already created one.
Download the MP Universal Waiver Form, fill it out, and upload it.
For medical exemptions, a statement from your then or current medical doctor will constitute compliancy.  If that is not available, then a lab titer document will suffice.
For religious exemptions, complete and sign the MP Universal Waiver Form. A document with only a typed signature, or that purports to come from someone else will be disapproved.
If further instruction is required, consult steps 6 - 11 on the Immunization Compliancy guide.

[6/7/23, 2:45:23 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi Dhyey!  I do not have a firm number for the fees as that is not really my department.  I generally just use this moneysmarts calculator: https://moneysmarts.iu.edu/calculate-costs/index.html?page=tuitionAndFees  I drop in the pertinent information and go from there.  There is a "request an appointment" button here so you may be to use that to get a specific amount for your fees.  A suggestion here, always add about $1k to be sure.  The Board of Trustees has not met for their annual meeting, so the numbers for  2023-2024 have not been set yet.  ~Amy

1. HDFC is good if you are going for non collateral and higher loan amounts. Likewise higher processing fee and ROI
2. Union Bank is the best interest rate (9.8%) wise, up to 40 Lakhs no collateral required for premium institutes ( IUB included) and 0 processing fee.
3. SBI is very bad by taking very long processing time and collateral is compulsory.
It took 7 days to get sanction letter from Union Bank . 
I suggest Union Bank for IUB students

The interview went like this :-

1) why are you going to the US?
2)which year did you graduate?

The barcode at the back of my passport (this is stuck when you go for your biometric) was not being detected so the officer sent me to another counter to get it fixed. At biometric centre they stamp your Ds160 confirmation page, i was asked to produce the same when my barcode wasn't detecting at the second counter . They made me sit for 5-10 mins and once it worked i was asked to go back to the first counter again.

The officer asked me the first two questions again and proceeded to ask the ones below :
3) which other colleges did you apply to?
4)what's your cgpa?
5)where did you study undergrad?
6) what did you study?

We do not technically have a mascot but we are well known for our cream and crimson pinstripes.  There is not a clear meaning of "Hoosiers" but this is close:  
"Why is Indiana University called Hoosiers?
IHB: What is a Hoosier
They were called "Hoosier's men" and eventually all Indianans were called Hoosiers. A theory attributed to Gov. Joseph Wright derived Hoosier from an Native American word for corn, "hoosa." Indiana flatboatmen taking corn or maize to New Orleans came to be known as "hoosa men" or Hoosiers."  ~Amy

We are looking for a fifth roommate to join us in our 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom apartment. Four of us have already signed the lease of the Terra Trace Apartment. 

Our apartment is 0.6 miles away from the college which is just 10 mins walk.

Kroger is also close to us

The whole area of the apartment is 1947 sq ft.

Internet, oven, fridge, washer, stove, dryer, and water are also included. Apart from rent, you have to pay the electricity bill.

To be honest, we don’t have any preference and we four come from different parts of India.

So, we have one study room (12’ x 11’) whose closet and bathroom are outside the room. The rent for this will be 368$.

Another option is that you share the master bedroom (12’ x 13’-2’’) with me (Rahul). Then the rent will be 391$

If you are interested in joining us , for further details like the floor plan, pictures of the rooms and kitchen, or anything please feel free to DM me or

*Date:* June 15th, 2023
*Location:* Mumbai
*Counter*: 24 (not sure how to describe but he was wearing spectacles and had good hair, was clean shaved, looked handsome I can say)
*Slot*:9:00
*In time:*  Around 8:15
*Out time*: Around 9:15 to 9-30
*Visa Type:* F-1
*Status:* Approved
*Intake:* Fall, 2023
*University:* Indiana University Bloomington
*Course:* Master of Science in Data Science
*Interview Duration:* Less than a minute

VO looked at me and signaled with hand to come ahead

*Me:* Good Morning Officer, how are you doing?
*VO:* Good Morning. Pass me your I20 and SEVIS

—Looking through the I20 carefully—

*VO:* So you are going to which University?
*Me:* I am going to Indiana University at Bloomington for my Masters in Data Science course

*VO:* How many universities did you receive an admit from?
*Me:* i got admit from 5 universities officer. Apart from Indiana Univ......
(Interuppted)

*VO:* Name them
*Me:* Apart from IUB, University of Colorado Boulder, SUNY Buffalo, George Washington University, UT Arlington.

*VO:* Which university is the top ranking university among these?
*Me:* Officer Indiana University

*VO:* Why?
*Me:* I started saying why I choose this specific university and how it was better compared to other

Interuppted

*VO:* Did you understand my question?
*Me:*  (me confused) Yes officer, you asked why this is highly...

*VO:* I asked which is higest ranked among your admits?
*Me:* Indiana University Bloomington officer

*VO:* Oh really? Is it ranked better than George Washington University? (Starts frowning)
*Me:* yes officer, it is. Atleast for Data Science program it is

He started typing something with that frowned look, but I could see from his spectacle's reflection that it was a blue screen (and not a white screen) so I knew he was not googling if GWU is better of IUB)

*VO:*  How are you funding your education?
*Me:* i have secured an education loan of Xx lakhs and my father is my primary sponsor supporting me with his savings of XX lakhs and provident funds of XX lakhs. We also have liquid assets worth XX lakhs and immovable property worth XX lakhs.


*VO:*- Ok your visa is approved (not sure what he said after that)

—Passed the white slip and I20—

*Me:* Thanks a lot officer. Have a great day!


My 2 cents - Be confident, this is a cliche tip ik but it is really important and the only way to build that is by giving ample number of mocks with random people. Additionally, I checked 80% of the interview experiences being shared on different whatsapp groups for this F1 visa cycle and I would make a note of every question that I had not prepared for (this is a lot of work ik and most people won't like this idea but it made me really confident before going for VI today). It worked for me. 

2 girls in front of me got rejected. Not sure why 1st one was rejected, but the 2nd one got rejected because she gave very long answer for "Why going to US for Bachelors degree?"

If it matters, I presented myself in front of VO by standing in front of the counter with my hands at my back and straight shoulder + back. VO was sitting.

Good luck guys

He can write the vaccine according to the date it has  been or has to be administered based on your DOB. Submit it in  Med proctor. They immediately approve it. The only thing left will be the TB test which has to be done in the US . You can do that with your health insurance once you land in the US.

I'm slightly worried about this if it would create an issue in the VAC or Interview. 

But details like name, passport no, DS160, are correct.

Does anyone know if it would create an issue in future ?
[6/18/23, 6:05:09 AM] ‪+91 97634 85674‬: Hi,
As part of the vaccinations, do we also have to take the booster dose for Covid?

6, 9 and 3. Try sticking on these routes as they are more routine 

Bloomingtontransit.com is a place to check the status

Current at Latimer and other apartments where it starts at $900 . Put more efforts and you will be able to find something good

[6/20/23, 2:04:49 AM] ‪+91 97697 32670‬: I have been trying to find a job for the past 2 months yet cant get one
[6/20/23, 2:08:30 AM] ‪+91 86524 55659‬: Yepp, the 105k figure will include the local students as well as the number can be skewed easily if very few students are getting great offers
[6/20/23, 2:11:16 AM] ‪+91 91 6351 876 4‬: Yeah the market is tough right now for international students
[6/20/23, 2:12:05 AM] ‪+91 91 6351 876 4‬: And AI is leading to companies having much leaner engineering teams. And of course, local students will be preferred more.
[6/20/23, 2:12:30 AM] ‪+91 91 6351 876 4‬: It's gonna be a pretty uphill battle for our batch
[6/20/23, 2:12:55 AM] ‪+91 73500 34711‬: Depends on the market mostly
[6/20/23, 2:13:40 AM] ‪+91 91 6351 876 4‬: Yeah hopefully things will be better by the time we graduate

[6/20/23, 4:29:24 AM] ‪+91 70107 64644‬: Guys don't go for Ig tests , they are costly and very few labs only do that. Moreover you have to do it for BCG, Tdap( 2 tests), Varicella, DPT( 3 tests),  MMR( 3 tests). So create a schedule with your DOB and give it to your family doctor. He will sign and give .

[6/20/23, 4:57:10 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: You only need MMR and Varicella testing
[6/20/23, 4:57:45 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: In India normally given is TT its just tetanus
[6/20/23, 5:21:52 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: What I am telling is normally for any injury we are given TT injection not Tdap injection TT is just tetanus shot. Tdap is available in India if you want to have it just ask doctor they can give.

Quick question on the immunisation part. If you are 24 years and have already had chickenpox, you would need the following vaccines from the list provided right?
1. MMR
2. TDAP
[6/21/23, 7:04:39 AM] ‪+91 73774 66854‬: Hi guys, 

Anyone traveling from Chicago by bus?

[6/21/23, 7:05:25 AM] ‪+91 73774 66854‬: Aug 6th
[6/21/23, 7:05:46 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: I am coming on 7th
[6/21/23, 7:05:55 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: Was thinking of car pooling
[6/21/23, 7:05:57 AM] ‪+91 6376 033 318‬: Maybe
[6/21/23, 7:06:06 AM] ‪+91 73774 66854‬: Yeah same
[6/21/23, 7:06:54 AM] ‪+91 99964 69559‬: Me either on 7 or 8
[6/21/23, 7:08:33 AM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: I am also coming on 7th and car pooling won't be a feasible idea because of cost and luggage space in a car on the other side in a bus we can pay for extra luggage and it'll be significantly cheaper than a car
[6/21/23, 7:09:21 AM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: Traveling from Chicago 😅

As previously mentioned in this group by Ritika, ICICI Bank or SBI Bank are good options for Forex.
Additionally, Niyo Forex Card (a partner of SBI bank) can't be used because it has stopped international transactions. 

So everyone is going for ICICI bank forex card? Are there any other options you guys are planning to explore?
[6/22/23, 6:19:49 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: I m planning for NiyoX

[6/22/23, 9:35:37 AM] ‪+91 70104 11684‬: Hello, everyone. My name is Anirudh. I'm from Chennai. I am an incoming grad student in the IU Ms. Cybersecurity Risk Management Program. I have signed a contract for a 2 bed/1 bath apartment at the campus view apartments. I am searching for a roommate (Male grad student preferred). The rent is $660 per person (including utilities and internet). It has a $200, one time only application fee and no security deposit. It is an IU Unfurnished apartment, so, it is super close to campus. (0.9-1 mile from Luddy) and all the nearby groceries, including college mall. To add to it, there's a bus stop in front of Campus view.

I'm generally a quiet and clean person who prefers having his own space and privacy. Not a big fan of throwing parties. Besides, I am largely focused on doing well academically and paying off my bills at this point. I am also respectful of others, their spaces and their opinions. This won't take away from the fact that I am a friendly person, either. I'd prefer roommates who are quiet, clean and simple. I prefer a peaceful environment when I come back from classes and living with people who are even tempered and responsible. If you know how to cook, that would be even better because I am just a beginner. I don't smoke and I'd prefer roommates who don't, too. 

I am a non vegetarian. So, I'd rather my roommate be a non-vegetarian or someone who doesn't have an issue with non-veg being cooked at home.

If you are not very sure about the registration for IU housing, I can walk you through the process. It's fairly simple. Please feel free to DM me if interested and we can talk.

You can enter the US at any port of entry, but you will need to go through customs wherever that entry point is.  Doing a "pre-clearance" somewhere else (Abu Dhabi for example) is not acceptable as your US customs entrance.  They do not issue you your I94 document, which you are required to upload into your Atlas account so that you can actually stay in the US for the duration of your education. ~Amy

[6/22/23, 1:13:16 PM] ‪+91 70958 92125‬: Hello everyone,

I'm currently seeking roommates for a 3-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom house located in East Hillside. The monthly rent for the house is `$1350`, excluding utilities, and it will be available starting from August 7, 2023.

Regarding the rent, we can discuss and form a group to determine the amount per person.

Here are some details about the house: It consists of three bedrooms, with one measuring `13"0 x 13"0` and the remaining two each averaging `11"0 x 11"0`. Additionally, there is a den along with a spacious living and dining area. The house is situated on the east side of town, conveniently close to Kroger and College Mall. There is also a nearby bus stop where you can catch the 4 and 5 number buses.

A few amenities provided in the house include in-unit laundry and a refrigerator.

A little bit about myself: My name is Sandeep, and I am from Andhra Pradesh. I will be joining the MS DS program as a new student. During my bachelor's degree, I lived in hostels, so I am accustomed to adjusting with others. I respect people's privacy and expect the same in return. I don't smoke, and although I eat non-vegetarian food, it's not a regular occurrence, so I don't mind any different food preferences.

If anyone is interested or has any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

[6/22/23, 3:40:19 PM] ‪+1 (812) 778‑5064‬: PhD student seeking a female roommate for my 2 BR / 2 bath apartment (move-in date negotiable for mid-August). The apartment is almost fully furnished, from living room furniture to kitchenware, and even has a bed in the second bedroom - all you need is whatever other bedroom furniture you'd like to bring. There is an in-unit washer and dryer. This location is about a 10 minute drive from campus, so it's best suited to someone who drives. Your half of rent + utilities will be around $600-650 a month.
I am quiet, friendly, studious, and prefer to keep things clean. I also have a small dog, Clover, so liking dogs is a must. She would probably do best without other pets.
If you or someone you know might be a good fit to room with Clover and me, I'd love to hear from you!  Olivia ohphilli@iu.edu

[6/23/23, 3:57:51 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: 8 August
[6/23/23, 3:58:27 AM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: okay, you may meet me and I can give you a better picture of it, in person
[6/23/23, 3:58:59 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: I have to enroll right now
[6/23/23, 3:59:08 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: So that's why I am asking how these subs are
[6/23/23, 3:59:23 AM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: It would be better if u could give me a gist of these subs, if it's okay with you
[6/23/23, 4:06:04 AM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: okay so in any kind of data analysis the basic thing is that you have some phenomenon going on which you can't observe, but what you can observe are some sort of outputs produced by the phenomenon. A very low level example would be to think of earthquakes. You can't observe the happenings at the level of tectonic plates which give rise to earthquakes, but you can measure effects of an earthquake, such as the location where it happened or its intensity, etc..
So these observations are your data. You however want to make inference about the phenomena itself. For instance, in the above example you may like to know about some future earthquake.
So, one thing you can do is you just study the observations you have and make predictions. That's predictive analysis. Now one also does more serious things like understand the quality of predictions you produce, etc..

That's the big picture of data analysis. You study the data to make inference. Based on what kind of inference you make you get different branches of the subject.

As a slightly more interesting example you are going to do predictive analysis based on my comment about the subject to predict whether it will be a relevant and/or important course for you or not.

[6/23/23, 4:09:13 AM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: I don't know the professor. The subject is in a developing stage, so it is going to be dynamic I believe. You will be using state of the art methods, so I believe it would be enough exciting to more feel that difficult.

[6/26/23, 9:58:31 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes because in US aadhar won't be valid
[6/26/23, 9:58:41 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: So you can generate one with passport number
[6/26/23, 9:58:57 AM] ‪+91 99624 49511‬: Okayy. Thanks 🙌
[6/26/23, 9:59:56 AM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: Is covid vaccination certificate necessary?
[6/26/23, 10:01:24 AM] ‪+91 99624 49511‬: Yeah, i heard they might check during boarding or at port of entry. So its better to carry.
[6/26/23, 10:01:53 AM] ‪+91 86868 67215‬: We can just link the cert with a passport and it's enough right ?

[6/26/23, 10:03:25 AM] ‪+91 86868 67215‬: U can do that in cowin website
[6/26/23, 10:03:50 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: I took covishield, will it work in the same way here?
[6/26/23, 10:05:31 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Vaccine brand doesn't matter
[6/26/23, 10:05:32 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Normally vaccine certificate contains aadhar number just need to change it to passport number
[6/26/23, 10:08:09 AM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: ohh and one more doubt, my name is different in covid certificate i.e., normal version where initials aren't expanded, and in case of passport my initials are expanded will it cause in issue here.

A lot of us received emails about tornado warning yesterday. I hope everything’s okay there?
[6/26/23, 1:54:29 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yup
[6/26/23, 1:55:52 PM] ‪+91 70131 99973‬: Which consulate?

[6/26/23, 1:56:35 PM] ‪+91 70131 99973‬: I heard that hyd people are still waiting from June 10
[6/26/23, 4:12:38 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: We did have some storms go through yesterday but tornado did not touch in Bloomington, but two different ones did touch down within an hour of here.  Here is a video of one:  https://www.wlky.com/article/video-tornado-indiana-johnson-county-bargersville/44346250#
[6/26/23, 4:15:06 PM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: Oh lord, that looks scary and terrible!
[6/26/23, 4:15:56 PM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: I realised that we never talked about such stuff and what we should do in such situations
[6/26/23, 4:20:18 PM] ‪+91 81302 01142‬: It broke through so many houses! I can’t even imagine what people in those towns must have gone through. How did you guys manage it?
[6/26/23, 9:58:21 PM] ‪+91 82979 70404‬: ‎‎‪+91 82979 70404‬ changed their phone number to a new number. ‎Tap to message or add the new number.
[6/26/23, 4:26:40 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Yes, they can be scary but you will receive those alerts via text and email.  We also have a professor here that is extremely on top of emergency management.  He sends out detailed alerts prior to storms coming to make sure everyone is aware of the potential for extreme weather, rain, snow or tornados. 

Basic severe thunderstorm or tornado actions are to take cover on the lowest floor of a building or an interior room away from windows.  I would suggest that you all do a quick google search to know what to do.  Most buildings in the US have emergency directions, so is always good to note where you should go.  

That video was the tornado that hit about 45 minutes away from campus, so we did not see it here.  Quite a few of the buildings that it hit were new construction and no lived there yet, which was a great blessing!!

There are actually two Chase banks right in Bloomington.  And there are more than 4, 700 branches in the US.  Most ATMs will accept a variety of bank cards, but you will most likely be charged if you have a card from one bank and the ATM is from another.  ~Amy

[6/28/23, 1:26:12 PM] ‪+91 77760 59802‬: Is it mandatory to get the health insurance from IUB only? Or can we get it from outside?
[6/28/23, 1:41:37 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: It is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Main reason is because IU health is accepted at all local hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in the area, so they are "in network." If you have an insurance that is "not in network," you will be paying more out of pocket.  If you still choose to get a different insurance, then you need to contact OIS.

Questions asked :
1. You are going to Indiana University? 
2. What will you be studying there? 
3. When did you graduate? 
4. What have you been doing since then? 
5. How are you funding your education? 

Few things I noticed: 
1. I was pretty nervous when I got to the counter but I managed to smile and wish the VO. She asked how am I doing and told her I'm okay but a bit nervous and the VO smiled back and said that's okay, pretty natural - which actually humanised the entire experience more for me and helped to move ahead. A smile really helps. 
2. Ofcourse, you'll be nervous but as long as you can mention all the relevant information and convey that to the officer properly, you'll be fine. I saw a lot of people who couldn't speak clearly but officer actually helped them to get to the answer. 
3. A lot of people going for CS, DS were mentioning that they want to get into AI, to which the VO asked about the relevant companies who are doing things in AI field and specifically asked not to mention ChatGPT. So just be prepared to mention extra information if asked.  

Overall: 
It's a pretty nerve wrecking process - at least the waiting part, bu if you've prepared well, you should be able to get your approval! All the best! 🤗

[7/6/23, 12:32:09 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *TRANSCRIPT UPDATE FROM OIS*   Regarding your transcripts, marksheets and degree conferrals.  OIS would like your documents in sealed envelopes.  All documents need to be *OFFICIAL* (no photo copies are allowed, no exceptions).  This means they have a original ink stamp or impressed seal from the issuing institution.  Having the sealed envelope allows the OIS officers a better chance of considering your documents as official for review.  Having a sealed envelope now helps eliminate any questions or further issues later on.  If your envelope has been opened, keep that envelope with your documents.  ~Amy
[7/6/23, 12:34:25 PM] ‪+91 89763 00750‬: Only transcripts can be sealed right?
[7/6/23, 12:34:54 PM] ‪+1 (765) 490‑5859‬: For international students, do we need to get our transcripts (from Indian schools) evaluated by WES (world education services)? If yes, can we share the a copy evaluated transcript directly from WES?
[7/6/23, 12:35:52 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: Not required
[7/6/23, 12:36:23 PM] ‪+91 97370 13144‬: Marksheet photo copies signed and stamped by the University registrar counts as official ? Or do we need to seal the original marksheet ?
[7/6/23, 12:36:48 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: See if your university is provinding official transcripts. Otherwise get the photocopies of the docs and get us sealed and signed by registrar or similar authorities. And they get it in a sealed envelope. That’s all.
[7/6/23, 12:36:50 PM] ‪+91 94454 89090‬: @18123409769 Hope you are doing fine. I have graduated recently, and when I enquired to my college about the degree certificate, they said it will take some more time, i.e., it might be available by August end or September start, but they said they will give me a provisional certificate in the mean time, is this fine or something else need to be done?

[7/6/23, 12:38:50 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Hey Amy, I don't have a link to this info. I got this info from one of the incoming graduate students for different University
[7/6/23, 12:41:19 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: I think you can send a signed and sealed copy of degree certificate or produce original when you reach there.

[7/6/23, 12:50:47 PM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: Bruh, I will give you 500 bucks if any university would even take the patience to put it in an A3 size envelope
[7/6/23, 12:50:56 PM] ‪+91 97695 06008‬: I too am facing this problem my college provided me a small one, and they said to fold
[7/6/23, 12:51:12 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: That’s also fine
[7/6/23, 12:51:15 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: of course my university would.
[7/6/23, 12:51:19 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: :)
[7/6/23, 12:51:28 PM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: But are you sure a degree certificate is supposed to be handed to a uni?
[7/6/23, 12:51:39 PM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: Mumbai unis got sass bro
[7/6/23, 12:51:39 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: I had to send from two universities…one university used a smaller one…so definitely folded paper.
[7/6/23, 12:51:53 PM] ‪+91 97695 06008‬: For degree they said provide true copy
[7/6/23, 12:52:19 PM] ‪+91 88856 09526‬: @18123409769 I have the consolidated mark sheet which was given at the time of graduation can that also be considered as official transcripts or individual mark sheets are considered?
[7/6/23, 12:52:20 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: Not sure what sass means here
[7/6/23, 12:52:22 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: Degree certificate also you can send signed and sealed copy or give when you reach there.
[7/6/23, 12:53:35 PM] ‪+91 98803 08796‬: We get only transcripts in sealed envelope right? Other documents such as marksheets and degree certificates are not given with the sealed envelope Right ?
[7/6/23, 12:55:41 PM] ‪+91 90162 85136‬: Hello, sorry a few things are still not clear to me. We get the official transcripts that would be sealed directly from University but marksheets and the degree certificate that we already have needs to be photocopies with stamp and sign from University or it should be original marksheets and degree certificate in the envelope?
[7/6/23, 12:55:52 PM] ‪+91 70131 99973‬: ‎This message was deleted.
[7/6/23, 12:56:40 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: I’ll explain my scenario.. I had to send from two universities as I have two degrees. Univ A had official transcripts service so they sent the official transcripts. Univ B didn’t have that exactly. So I took copies of mark sheets and degree certificate and got it signed and sealed in a sealed envelope. OIS has accepted these. Apart from these OIS had asked me to send degree certificate from Univ A as  I had sent only transcripts. Rest of the docs were also accepted.
[7/6/23, 12:57:01 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: No, IUB does not accept WES evaluations.  Save that money!  ~Amy
[7/6/23, 12:57:28 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Transcript should be in sealed envelope and marksheets and degree should be original and not photocopy
[7/6/23, 12:58:02 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: And since marksheet and degree are once in a life time document you can ask OIS to return those back
[7/6/23, 12:58:04 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: I hope this will clear many doubts.
[7/6/23, 12:58:44 PM] ‪+1 (765) 490‑5859‬: Thank you!!
[7/6/23, 12:59:13 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: You can send in your provisional degrees, but OIS may ask you for the conferred degree once it is completed by your university.  ~Amy
[7/6/23, 12:59:18 PM] ‪+91 90162 85136‬: So no need to have a different signed envelope of original marksheets and degree certificate? We can just hand them over directly without any sealed envelope?
[7/6/23, 12:59:22 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: wait so see, for getting admitted to the maths dept at IUB, I had to send them my transcripts. It needed to be (folded and) put in an envelope, the envelope needed to be stamped and signed by the dean of studies at my univ; then it needed to be put inside a (greenish) courier envelope and then that needed to be sent
[7/6/23, 12:59:32 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: I hope the procedure would roughly be the same
[7/6/23, 12:59:53 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yes
[7/6/23, 12:59:59 PM] ‪+91 98803 08796‬: So we don't need marks sheets and degree certificates to be in sealed envelope ?
[7/6/23, 1:00:08 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Not needed
[7/6/23, 1:00:28 PM] ‪+91 95440 90656‬: This has both scenarios.
[7/6/23, 1:00:39 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Since non of the University gives these things in sealed envelope so OIS is aware about these things
[7/6/23, 1:00:45 PM] ‪+91 98803 08796‬: Thanks
[7/6/23, 1:01:52 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Not sure about Maths but atleast for Luddy we can hand carry everything to OIS but transcript need to be in a sealed envelope with University Seal
[7/6/23, 1:02:59 PM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: yeah I mean in my case too I could have handed them in person but it needed to be done when I applied, so I sent by courier.
[7/6/23, 1:03:45 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Cool
[7/6/23, 1:56:13 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Regarding your questions about your particular circumstances with your transcripts, marksheets and degree conferral, it will best if you contact OIS directly.  There is not a "one answer for all" because as you can see by the questions, many of you have a variety of scenarios.  So, if in doubt, please contact OIS directly.  What worked for one person may not be applicable to you and it is best to figure this out now while you are still processing your paperwork.  ~Amy
[7/6/23, 2:19:03 PM] ‪+91 92841 15281‬: My university gave me folded transcripts in a sealed envelope so I don't think folds matter that much 😅
[7/6/23, 2:20:03 PM] ‪+91 98673 82325‬: Just fold it, it's fine, I have been given A3 papers with simple envelopes

[7/10/23, 12:28:05 PM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: Can we claim the TB testing payment with our university medical insurance?
[7/10/23, 12:40:12 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is what is stated on the OIS website:  https://ois.iu.edu/admissions/prepare-first-year/vaccinations/index.html

You will need to have a TB blood test done at the Student Health Center shortly after your arrival. You will not be able to register for your second semester classes until you complete it. The test (which costs $100) and any additional follow-up testing can be billed to your bursar account. This cost can be reimbursed for students enrolled in the IU health insurance plan.
[7/10/23, 1:15:36 PM] ‪+91 6309 735 411‬: Hey
Are both doses of meningococcal required or is one dose enough?(for people aged 21 or younger)
[7/10/23, 1:16:33 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Immunization requirements

[7/10/23, 1:18:38 PM] ‪+91 6309 735 411‬: Well here it's mentioned only one is required.
But in the immunization certificate both the first and second dose dates are required?!
So I'm a bit confused😅
[7/10/23, 1:19:57 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: This is what is stated on the website:    IU is requiring immunizations that cover the MenACWY (also known as MCV4) serogroup and although not a state requirement, strongly recommends that students be vaccinated for the MenB serogroup.
[7/10/23, 1:20:48 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If you have further questions, you will want to email immune@indiana.edu or call 812-855-6500, option 3.  They know this information best. ~Amy

[7/10/23, 1:40:29 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Correct.  But be sure these are ORIGINAL documents, not photocopies.

[7/12/23, 4:08:22 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: Only 1 bag of max 7kg weight is allowed
[7/12/23, 4:09:26 AM] ‪+1 (765) 490‑5859‬: Okay I haven’t had issues in the past. 
Usually they allow one personal item which has been my laptop bag. But since you spoken to them, trust their word over mine.
[7/12/23, 4:11:57 AM] ‪+91 6302 968 847‬: Yes i guess like they mentioned it in website
[7/12/23, 4:12:39 AM] ‪+1 (765) 490‑5859‬: You might want to ask cabin bag + personal item (which they never weigh)
[7/12/23, 4:13:10 AM] ‪+91 77994 90360‬: So you're planning on keeping the laptop inside the cabin luggage?
[7/12/23, 4:14:12 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: I had asked that, is a laptop bag allowed apart from the cabin bag allowed or not
They said no if you are planning on bringing a laptop it will go in the 7kg cabin bag
[7/12/23, 4:14:39 AM] ‪+91 77994 90360‬: Ohh i see
[7/12/23, 4:15:04 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: Probably have no other option, so I am thinking of buying a large bagpack with laptop pocket which can hold 7kg weight
[7/12/23, 4:15:27 AM] ‪+91 70210 11374‬: Exactly. I've also called and confirmed this twice.
[7/12/23, 4:16:37 AM] ‪+91 98338 51552‬: There is no restriction on the measurement bit for the cabin bag, right?
[7/12/23, 4:17:10 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: There is with Emirates probably check Etihad website

[7/12/23, 4:37:15 AM] ‪+91 70938 85815‬: In IU Bloomington's case, Swift is not expected to show up and take part. She's currently on her record-breaking (and website-crashing, in Ticketmaster's case) Eras Tour, which sold over 2.4 million tickets in a single day.

For the past few years, Swift has become a high-profile case study on artist's rights through her contentious battle with music executives. Since leaving her former record label, Big Machine, she has been re-recording (and thereby owning) her first six albums, which led to a personalized revisiting of her previous "eras."

I just concluded my bachelor's degree in May 2023. My college has provided me with official transcripts and a provisional letter indicating that I have completed my undergraduate studies with a cumulative grade point average of 9.05. Since the University of Mumbai won't issue me a degree certificate until May 2024, will this provisional letter meet the requirements?

[7/14/23, 7:39:23 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: See suppose you paid on 25th and later decided to drop a lecture or revoke your admission
[7/14/23, 7:39:37 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: 10th Sep is deadline
[7/14/23, 7:39:47 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: You can always pay before that only
[7/14/23, 7:43:02 AM] ‪+91 86524 55659‬: Okay, but then what is Aug 27th deadline? like suppose you paid on Sep 5th (cos fee deadline is Sept 10th), now you wanna drop something or revoke admission, but the refund deadline is earlier than the fee deadline weirdly, so you can't drop anything now? ‎<This message was edited>
[7/14/23, 7:46:00 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: If you pay on 5th and revoke your admission or drop a class you are eligible for 50% refund until Sep 10

[7/14/23, 3:30:27 PM] ‪+91 98336 73565‬: Hey Guys, I contacted the ois regarding provisional degrees. Here's what they sent me.

They told me that unless we provide a *official college degree* (not provisional certificate), there would be a hold on our account and won't allow us to register for spring courses. 

My college won't be providing a degree but instead a provisional certificate. I think many of us would be in the same boat where we don't get the degree certificate when we land.

What should we do now? If anyone has any idea, please do help.

Will the provisional certificate work? Or do we need an official degree (which is highly unlikely)
[7/14/23, 3:31:20 PM] ‪+91 82867 45395‬: I think we can extend the hold
[7/14/23, 7:12:58 PM] ‪+91 83558 61148‬: $350 per day?
[7/14/23, 9:37:36 PM] ‪+91 97691 35007‬: Mail frm OIS:

Unfortunately, we cannot accept provisional degree certificates. Our office does understand that many students do not receive their final degrees and marksheets until a year or so later.
 
Once you arrive at IU, you will be able to request an extension of the A11 hold that will go into effect on your account on September 30. If you have not received your records by February, you will need to request a second extension. You do not need to do this now.
 
Please keep in mind that once your final degree certificate and final marksheets have been issued, you will need to submit those. Final degree certificates and marksheets (not paper transcripts) are considered irreplaceable and will be returned to you once they have been reviewed. As you as you receive them, please submit them to our office.

Before I got ahead with the questions I encountered during my interview. I would like to mention that not only  was I 30 mins late for my appointment due to traffic but the QR code behind the passport which we get during our biometric was also damaged. But still with all these problems my visa experience was like any other normal approved visa applicant.

1. Why do want to do masters?
2. What is your pervious degree?
3. When did you graduate?
4. Have to done any courses related to your CS program during your engineering?

Then she gave me the white slip and said that my visa has been approved and I'll be getting my visa within a week and that she will be keeping my passport.

[7/17/23, 1:19:45 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Hey Amy, Hope you are doing well. For TB test appointment it is asking for health insurance details which we don't have right now so if we select self pay now can we get it reimbursed when we get insurance details? If yes how can we file for reimbursement? ‎<This message was edited>
[7/17/23, 1:20:53 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: The refund deadline would only be for anyone who signed up for a class but decided to drop it.  If you did this by August 27th, you would receive a full 100% refund.  If you wait until Sept.3 to drop a class, you would only receive 75% of your money back. Make sense? ~Amy
[7/17/23, 1:23:21 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: You will request a A-11 hold extension until you are able to send in your degree certificate.  ~Amy

[7/17/23, 2:32:58 PM] ‪+91 97697 32670‬: Thank you Amy
[7/17/23, 6:40:33 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hello to all of you!  It has come to my attention that the health insurance dates for MS students has changed a bit, which is great news for you!  This is what is stated on the OIS website:  

Billing and coverage dates
The IU Health Insurance Fee is the premium you pay to be enrolled in the IU Plan. IU negotiates with Anthem to keep this fee as low as possible, but rates can increase every year. After you register for classes, OIS bills the fee to your bursar account, and IU gives that fee to Anthem to pay for your insurance premium.

Dates of insurance coverage are August 1 – December 31 for fall and January 1 – July 31 for spring and summer. New and returning students who begin or resume their studies in the summer are enrolled in the plan June 1 – July 31.

[7/17/23, 11:21:33 PM] ‪+91 98345 51196‬: Thank you for your inquiry. If you will be planning to enter the US in F-1 student non-immigrant status, it is important to note that the purpose and intent of F-1 student status is to be inside the US for full-time study. It is not an employment authorization/status. The US government will expect that you are inside the US for full-time study rather than for working, and the US government then significantly restricts those visiting the US as F-1 students for study from being able to work inside the US.

 

This is also why to qualify for an I-20 or for an F-1 visa the US government requires you to demonstrate that you already have the funding available to you to support yourself financially inside the US as an F-1 student. You need to be prepared to have the funding available to support yourself inside the US without relying on ongoing off-campus employment while you study.

 

The only employment allowed as an F-1 student for the purpose of working/earning money is on-campus employment. As an F-1 student at IU Bloomington, that would mean the US government would allow you to work on the IU Bloomington campus for Indiana University for up to 20 hours per week during the semesters. The US government would allow you to work on the IUB campus for IU for more than 20 hours per week during the IU breaks (those at IU are spring break, summer break, Thanksgiving break, and winter break). That is the only employment allowed for the purpose of working.

 

Anything off-campus in F-1 status has to be for the purpose of study through practical training. While taking classes that is through F-1 Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for which you will not be eligible until after completing one full academic year of study. For CPT to be authorized, your graduate program has to be able to document that the position is an integral part of the established study for students in that degree.

 

Working while inside the US in F-1 status without the proper F-1 status authorization is a SEVIS and F-1 violation. According to the US government, unauthorized employment ends one legally authorized F-1 stay inside the US.

 

For off-campus work it does not matter where your employer is located. It matters where you are located. If you are inside the borders of the United States in F-1 student status, you need CPT authorization for any off-campus work, in-person or online. That is true even if the online employer is located outside of the US. Online work is still work and is subject to all of the same F-1 status regulations. Even if the employer is located outside the US, you still need US government F-1 status authorization to conduct any work while you are inside the US in F-1 student status.

 

You will also find this information published for you in your required Staying in Status Immigration Session which will be part of your required Online International Orientation in your IU Canvas account.

 

Sincerely,

 

Kyle

[7/20/23, 4:15:05 AM] ‪+91 6352 419 455‬: In public interest:
I somehow missed recharging my brother's VI for 3 months, even though I had been regularly recharging it for the last 3 years. They took it off the market and sold it to someone else. There was no warning SMS or email, and now the new owner is not willing to resell it to me. So, it's better to recharge it for a year or switch to another network without such rigid terms.
[7/20/23, 4:16:05 AM] ‪+91 86524 55659‬: Gotta fix that bro
[7/20/23, 4:16:25 AM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: damn, with all these visa things going on I almost forgot that VI also stands for Vodafone+Idea. I was startled to read how visa interview was recharged.
[7/20/23, 4:16:39 AM] ‪+91 86524 55659‬: Wow my whole family is on VI, gotta stay upto date on recharges
[7/20/23, 4:17:55 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: Switch it to JIO doesn't require monthly recharges
[7/20/23, 4:18:07 AM] Aditya Aggarwal: And rates are much cheaper compared to other brands

[7/20/23, 2:28:49 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Ready for your tips of the day?
[7/20/23, 2:29:06 PM] Aditya Aggarwal: Yeah
[7/20/23, 2:31:11 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *TIP OF THE DAY #1*   Please be sure to carry your important documents (passport, i20, transcripts, marksheets, degree conferral etc...) in your carry on NOT in your checked luggage.  Think of what is easily replaced and what is NOT so easy to replace.  The not so easy goes wherever you go!!
[7/20/23, 2:45:11 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *TIP OF THE DAY #2*  This one is not meant to alarm or scare you, but to make you aware.  DHS (Dept of Homeland Security), FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) or any other government agency will NEVER call, text or email you stating that you need to give them money or gift cards to stay in the US.  Yes, this has happened and it scared the student.  

Trust me when I say these agencies do not bother with phone calls or gift cards if you have done something wrong!  *NEVER* believe anyone who states that you owe them money to stay in the US.  Report it to the authorities as soon as you can.  This includes emails.
[7/20/23, 2:53:10 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *TIP OF THE DAY #3*   Regarding email etiquette once you arrive at Luddy.  The first couple of weeks will be busy, stressful and exciting for all!!  Everyone comes at the same time and you will all have lots of questions.  We understand that, but PLEASE only email a department once and wait for a response. *READ* what is sent to you.  Open your CANVAS and read the messages that the Graduate Student Services team has posted there.  Do not have access to CANVAS yet?  Email gradvise@indiana.edu and they will re-send your invitation.  It is up to you to accept that invitation to get in!!
[7/20/23, 2:54:23 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: To all that have asked about which Health insurance to select for your TB appointment... I am still waiting for a response to my email.  Once I hear back, I will post on here.  Hopefully soon!  ~Amy
[7/20/23, 3:06:18 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *TIP OF THE DAY #4*   Crimson Card pickup is ONLY at Wells Library location in room W138.   If you selected the IMU (Indiana Memorial Union), that office has been closed.  ~Amy

[7/20/23, 3:22:24 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: You can pick up your card during these times, according to the Crimson card website:  For walk-in services, CrimsonCard offices are available at the following Card Services locations.

[7/20/23, 3:47:34 PM] ‪+91 99749 59775‬: Okay soo I need to inform them that I am a graduate student that's it right!..
[7/20/23, 4:18:25 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Crimson Card services sent this to me just now about picking up your cards at the New Student Orientation:

So I was hoping to ask if anyone here who has their lease starting earlier can be kind enough to let me stay at your place for a week? Please if it's possible, you can just let me know and I'll contact you for further discussion. Bedding won't be an issue. I'll bring my own and staying in hall also is completely okay for me 👍.

[7/22/23, 3:16:23 PM] ‪+1 (812) 778‑4571‬: it depends from bank to bank. Forex cards such as Niyo, BookMyForex and ICICI charge something around 3-5% while transferring forex card amount into USA bank account. But I have heard from some of my friends that if you take both loan and forex card from HDFC bank, then HDFC doesn't charge you any kind of amount for transferring your funds to USA bank account..
But I would still suggest you to get it clarified from your forex card issuers....

[7/24/23, 11:38:21 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Hi all.  Like I promised, I do have more information on scheduling your TB appointment.  This is directly from the Student Health Center:  

If students have insurance, they should schedule their appointment after their insurance goes into effect (after August 1st). It will not be covered otherwise. 

Yes, they should select Blue Cross Blue Shield - PPO.  They will need to input their subscriber ID number and group number. If they don’t have their insurance information yet, they should select self-pay. The charge will go to their bursar account but they can be reimbursed if they provide insurance details to the Student Health Center within 60 days from the date of service.
[7/24/23, 11:39:33 AM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: So I would suggest waiting until after you see your insurance information in Student Central, then schedule your appointment if you have not done so already. ~Amy

[7/24/23, 12:08:52 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: If you wish to have a different insurance you will need to contact OIS.  Here is more information on the IU insurance. https://ois.iu.edu/living-in-the-us/health/insurance/student-insurance/index.html

[7/31/23, 1:26:50 AM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: Cool, also I will be travelling in Ethihad till New York. So in between while changing flight at abudhabi my luggage will be taken care by them only right?
[7/31/23, 1:27:19 AM] ‪+91 81062 38516‬: I booked my flight tickets through the Etihad website. 
From chennai to Indianapolis. So I have to go through 2 connecting flights, do we need to collect our checked-in luggage either in Abu dhabi or new york? Or we can directly collect it at Indianapolis airport?
[7/31/23, 1:28:27 AM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: At New York we have to collect and move it to another flight right?
[7/31/23, 1:29:31 AM] ‪+91 98803 08796‬: They will only do it right , since it's a connecting flight of airlines and not separately booked tickets
[7/31/23, 1:29:43 AM] ‪+91 95662 12535‬: I asked them, they told me approximately if your weight is increasing from 25 to 32kgs it's $140. If you are getting an extra luggage of 25kgs it's $300. 
They told it's approximate charges could be more or less
[7/31/23, 1:30:24 AM] ‪+91 93816 97480‬: I am also confused need answer for the same
[7/31/23, 1:30:36 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: There's still confusion about this. Some are saying we need to collect it at NY and some say directly at Indianapolis airport this being connecting flight. But we need to request at Chennai counter for the same.
[7/31/23, 1:31:05 AM] ‪+91 75501 67751‬: If anyone travelled recently via Etihad please let us know if they still allow a light personal bag/purse along with a cabin bag?
[7/31/23, 1:31:39 AM] ‪+91 75501 67751‬: No we have to collect and do it ourselves
[7/31/23, 1:32:31 AM] ‪+91 93904 65154‬: Any idea about Emirates?
[7/31/23, 1:32:36 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: I had called them regarding this, they said that you have to tell them while checking in bags at Mumbai to put a tag for New York to Indianapolis too
If they have that facility there then we won't have to collect the bags, if they say no then we will have to collect and recheckin
[7/31/23, 1:34:13 AM] ‪+91 6374 083 863‬: Correct. We need to request the respective counters to tag our bags till the destination.
[7/31/23, 1:34:32 AM] ‪+91 75501 67751‬: If the airline is changing, like for me its changing to American Airlines, then we have to do it ourselves
[7/31/23, 1:34:59 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: No that's the reason you have to tell them separately
[7/31/23, 1:35:45 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: If it was purely Etihad there was no need for anything
I also have the same flight route

[7/31/23, 1:36:48 AM] ‪+91 75501 67751‬: When I called this was the information I got from Etihad. I also asked about the Airport transfer they said everything needs to be taken care by us. We will receive the bags at Newyork only
[7/31/23, 1:38:58 AM] ‪+91 90048 56458‬: Try calling once again and ask them about this facility once
Because I had called twice and talked to 2 different people they gave the same answer, so we will get a final confirmation 😅
[7/31/23, 1:40:53 AM] Dilip Nikhil: Talk to the staff at the airport!
[7/31/23, 1:41:25 AM] Dilip Nikhil: Ask them to directly send it to Indie if it's possible. If not JFK then.
[7/31/23, 1:42:03 AM] Dilip Nikhil: The agent I spoke to told me last is JFK. Then gotta check in ourselves.

[7/31/23, 6:53:44 AM] Dev Patel, IU: I arrived in the US on 27th July, here’s my experience with carrying the cabin luggage:
I carried both, a backpack and a cabin bag, my backpack weighed around 3.5 kgs because of my laptop and documents, and my cabin weighed around 7kgs, total 11kgs. During the check-in, i did request him to allow me to carry it since i am student, luckily he did allow me but asked me to put my back pack inside the cabin bag and carry just the laptop in sleeve. So during the journey my two peices were a cabin bag and a laptop sleeve. I did not pay anything for the extra weight, I took everything along with me but just had to make it look like it’s just a one peice that i am carrying.
[7/31/23, 6:55:27 AM] Dev Patel, IU: I travelled with Emirates

[7/31/23, 8:38:43 AM] ‪+91 78389 78487‬: I travelled with Etihad on 20th July

They did not weigh any hand luggage, I had a backpack,  a hand bag and one small suitcase, they just asked me to put my hand bag in the suitcase (because we cannot carry three hand luggages).

Weight of my suitcases were 23.8 and 23.5 kgs, the guy didn’t bother.

Also. They just scanned my i20 in the immigration, didn’t ask anything but there was one guy at the airport, who was asked about the food items/spices he was carrying and all.

Also, my airline was changing ( I also had layover in NY and airline changed to american airlines, they transferred the luggage by themselves, I didn’t have to do it, but my luggage did not arrive on the same day, it got delivered on the next day)
[7/31/23, 8:39:52 AM] ‪+91 89025 69499‬: wow thanks, nice

[7/31/23, 8:43:15 AM] ‪+91 78389 78487‬: Suitcase weighed 7 kgs, backpack just had one laptop and hang bag was v small, 2-3 kgs I guess

[7/31/23, 9:25:28 AM] ‪+1 (585) 981‑0761‬: For Etihad you get the luggage directly at the last location if all of your flights were of etihad and just one last(domestic) is of other airlines
You need to collect only if uou you have more than one domestic flights which are of other airlines than etihad

[8/3/23, 9:59:11 AM] ‪+91 81692 26821‬: 1kg they allow
[8/3/23, 10:02:15 AM] ‪+1 (812) 803‑9913‬: When I was at the airport yesterday, I saw that some airlines like ethihad and Air France/KLM were much stricter than other airlines - even weighing laptop bag and cabin bags. I would suggest be within the limit for these airlines because you never know what they would ask you to throw away
[8/3/23, 10:18:25 AM] ‪+91 78753 55290‬: Do we need to carry original marksheets from 10th till now?

[8/3/23, 10:31:30 AM] ‪+1 (812) 803‑9913‬: Honestly I saw some bag check in stations allow laptop+cabin (like putting laptop bag inside cabin bag) and some stations outright said if you keep laptop bag inside and the cabin weighs more than 7kg you'll need to throw stuff out 🤷‍♀️
[8/3/23, 10:31:44 AM] ‪+91 90493 20957‬: Guys quick question,

On the flight ticket if while booking, we have mentioned our First Name and Last Name only, rather than mentioning the complete name like First Middle and Last, will it be okay?
[8/3/23, 10:31:45 AM] ‪+91 90493 20957‬: Since your passport has the complete name in it
[8/3/23, 10:31:47 AM] ‪+91 90493 20957‬: This is for Etihad Airlines
[8/3/23, 10:32:00 AM] ‪+91 94285 35694‬: You can keep your laptop bag inside the cabin bag and once security check is over take it out
[8/3/23, 10:33:15 AM] ‪+91 83569 61461‬: During immigration if they ask 
If we have any food items so do we need to say no or yes?
[8/3/23, 10:39:03 AM] ‪+91 86868 67215‬: I'll be traveling Etihad tomorrow early in the morning, and I'm taking one backpack with laptop+cabin stuff in it, weighing around 8-8.5kg

[8/3/23, 10:40:45 AM] ‪+91 98212 13322‬: Does OIS take attested marksheets or do they need the original ones?
[8/3/23, 10:42:31 AM] ‪+91 88797 42474‬: Has anybody traveled through indigo Turkish yet?
[8/3/23, 10:46:25 AM] ‪+91 96194 88285‬: Be prepared to remove stuff
[8/3/23, 10:46:27 AM] ‪+91 96194 88285‬: Cuz at home it's 8-8.5

[8/3/23, 10:52:47 AM] ‪+91 98331 77759‬: But there will be an option to put stuff in check in bag or pay extra on per kg basis

Dear Graduate Students,
 
With the semester beginning soon, I realize that many of you are looking for teaching assistantships (AIs). It is understandable.
 
However, we request that you please refrain from sending unsolicited email to faculty (or knocking on their office doors) looking for AI positions. They are likely to ignore these emails – because of their sheer quantity (from a population of 1,000+ graduate students), it is impractical for faculty to respond. 
 
Instead, there is a better and more efficient process for everyone - please email the departmental representative in charge of AI assignments with your application (a resume and courses that you would be most suited for, e.g., those you have already taken and where obtained a good grade). They will make AI assignments in consultation with faculty and they can look at the applications submitted appropriately.
 
Here are the representatives for each department:
CS: Pope, Charles E cepope@indiana.edu, ideally directly use this link: https://help.luddy.indiana.edu/aisched/index.html
ILS: Fichman, Pnina fichman@indiana.edu (PhD students only)
INFO: Duncan, J: johfdunc@indiana.edu
ISE: Garyfallidis, Eleftherios elef@indiana.edu

[9/15/23, 1:41:47 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *REMINDER TO ALL:*  You all should have received this email via the listserv, but I know how those email inboxes look😱, I am reposting here as your friendly reminder to get your official transcripts, marksheets and degree conferrals into OIS.  

From the Graduate Student Services team:   New students are required to submit final, official copies of your academic records and degree certificates or diplomas (these all must bear the stamp or seal of the issuing institution) 
If you still need to submit these official documents from your previous University and cannot have this completed before 9/30/23, an A11 hold (International Students)  or A32 hold (Domestic Students) will become active and you will be unable to register for the Spring 2024 term.

International students  should apply for a A11 hold extension hold  form (located on the Luddy Graduate forms and Resources webpage.)

Please provide your plans to get these documents to OIS including the  approximate date you will deliver the documents from your institution to OIS in the explanation portion of the form. Also include a brief explanation why you have not submitted the documents yet. (i.e. “my degree certificate and final marks sheet” will not be available until December 2023 from the University of Mumbai. I plan to have them mailed to OIS at that time. OIS should receive my “documents” by January 2024)
OIS will not grant the extension without a detailed plan in place to receive the documents, this includes the approximate date you intend to deliver the documents to OIS. (It is acceptable to use the month you will deliver them as a “date”.)**If this your plans do not include a date on the form you will be required to resubmit a new form. Be specific! 

Extensions granted by OIS will expire in February 2024 and the hold will become active again unless the documents are received before then. 
A11 hold postponement can only be extended twice and excludes if it is the students final term, in which case, it would be denied.

We strongly encourage you to work closely with your institution to provide this as soon as possible, or else this will continue to be an issue every term before you register.  
When your request is submitted, we will inform you. OIS will review your submission and let you know if your extension has been granted. 

To see holds on your record, visit https://one.iu.edu and search for “Record Holds”. Please observe the beginning and ending dates shown on the holds. The beginning and end dates will indicate if the hold is in place and affecting your account. If the hold is not affecting your account then no action is needed.
[9/15/23, 2:55:59 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: *Another reminder* The Career Fair is next Wednesday, September 20 at the Monroe Convention Center.  Please see this link to the Career Services website to look over their tips.  https://luddy.indiana.edu/career-services/career-fairs-events.html
[9/15/23, 3:01:05 PM] ‪+1 (812) 340‑9769‬: Pro tips from me😄 

1. WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES TO THE CENTER, then change into your dress shoes!  Don't roll your eyes!  I saw no less than 9 blistered/hurt feet last year!!!  But remember, if you need a band-aid, come find me. I can help.  There will be a room for you to stow your backpack away so you do not need to carry it all the time.  

2.  Get your resume updated and PRINTED OUT EARLY.  NOT ON WEDNESDAY.  Yes, I am repeating myself.  It bears repeating!!

3.  Remember to relax and smile.

[9/18/23, 5:53:59 PM] ‪+1 (812) 742‑1241‬: Hi guys, hope everyone's loving it in USA. 

In India, we have Ganesh Chathurti on 19th Sept, 2023 i.e tomorrow and in many parts of India, this festival is celebrated with a lot zeal. With our roots in India's beautiful culture and tradition, let's celebrate tomorrow's day here in the US as well. 

Requesting all of you to pitch in your own ideas for celebrating the day. One simple way for celebrating tomorrow's day can be by wearing traditional clothes, getting together and clicking some group photos (one Fall23 batch's group photo would be marvelous).

Additionally, let's not forget any coming festivals ahead either and instead, celebrate those together just like we would do in India.

So, people when free can just get together at that ground near IMU at any of the below timings -
4-5pm
8-9pm
Post 9pm

Hope to see you all and click some group pictures that we'll see back after a few years with a smile on your happy faces.

We're on the lookout for a sublease roommate to join us in a shared room in our 3-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom house at City Flats on Tenth Apartment.

Greetings International Students, 

I trust this message finds you well.

It has come to my attention that several students have recently submitted requests to alter the instruction mode of their courses, from in-person or hybrid to solely online (Zoom), or to seek exemption from attending the initial week(s) of classes. 

I take this opportunity to emphasize that our office has provided several reminders regarding enrollment requirements that apply to international students. These requirements limit international students to enroll in only one (1) online course per term and necessitate physical presence during the final term at IU. Enrollment requirements further stipulate that courses coded as "in-person" are classified as P, HY, IN, and IS. Faculty members are advised to exercise caution while teaching courses in a manner that does not compromise the students' status. For instance, teaching courses solely online (Zoom) that were coded as in-person classes would be inappropriate and a violation of enrollment requirements. 

While I acknowledge that we can face challenging times, it is crucial to bear in mind that all international students must comply with enrollment requirements to maintain their legal status in the United States.

We appreciate the value of your education and are committed to providing you with the necessary resources and support to succeed during these trying times. 
Please do not hesitate to contact your assigned staff academic advisor and OIS if any further assistance or support is required. 

We remain steadfast in our commitment to your success and wish you all the best in your studies.

Thank you,

Patty

Patricia (Patty) Reyes-Cooksey
